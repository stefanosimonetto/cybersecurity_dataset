Network up2date

Version 1.201 is a bug fix update which fixes seven bugs, including the limitation that Webadmin Single-Sign-On only works if ASG uses webadmin port tcp/443. – read on to get the details…

WebAdmin Single-Sign-On (SSO) now also works on non-standard tcp ports
ACC now supports WebAdmin SSO also for ports other than tcp/443. The ASG device agent sends the actual configured Webadmin port to ACC, which uses it for the SSO functionality. Now all ASG devices which have its Admin Interface on a non-standard tcp port can be managed and configured by ACC.
Remarks

Required previous version is 1.200
Existing configuration will not be changed
Depending on the speed of the CPU the Up2Date installation will take a few minutes
