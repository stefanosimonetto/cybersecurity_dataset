CIS Controls Implementation Guide for SMEs
[Word Count: 6]

Credit card breaches, identity theft, ransomware, theft of intellectual property, loss of 
privacy, denial of service – these cyber incidents have become everyday news. Victims include 
some of the largest, best-funded, and most security-savvy enterprises: government agencies, 
major retailers, financial services companies, even security solution vendors.
[Word Count: 46]

Many of the victims have millions of dollars to allocate for cybersecurity, yet still fall short in 
their efforts to defend against common attacks. What’s even more disturbing is that many 
of the attacks could have been prevented by well-known security practices such as regular 
patching and secure configurations.
[Word Count: 49]

So what are the rest of us supposed to do? How do organizations with small budgets and  
limited staff respond to the continuing cyber problem? This guide seeks to empower the 
owners of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to help them protect their businesses 
with a small number of high priority actions based on the Center for Internet Security’s 
Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls). The CIS Controls are a comprehensive set of 
cybersecurity best practices developed by IT experts that address the most common threats 
and vulnerabilities.
[Word Count: 87]

Some of the many concerns for SMEs include:
[Word Count: 8]

Theft of company information –  
External hackers and dissatisfied employees steal company information and customer lists.
[Word Count: 16]

Website defacement –  
Hackers corrupt your website to benefit competitors.
[Word Count: 10]

Phishing attacks –  
Email is designed to look like legitimate correspondence that tricks recipients into clicking on 
a link that installs malware on the system.
[Word Count: 25]

Ransomware –  
Types of malicious software block access to a computer so that criminals can hold your  
data for ransom.
[Word Count: 20]

Data loss due to natural events and accidents.
[Word Count: 8]

This guide contains a small sub-set of the CIS Controls specifically selected to help protect 
SMEs. Since such resources change from time to time, please contact CIS or check out our 
website for the most recent information (www.cisecurity.org).

CIS Controls Implementation Guide for SMEs
[Word Count: 6]

Security and good IT management go hand-in-hand: a well-managed network is more 
difficult to attack than a poorly managed one. To understand how well your organization  
is managing its cybersecurity, start by asking yourself these questions:
[Word Count: 36]

•	 Do you know what is connected to your computers and networks?
•	 Do you know what software is running on your systems and networks?
•	 Do you set up your computers with security in mind?
•	 Do you manage who has access to sensitive information or who has extra privileges? 
•	 Is your staff clear about their role in protecting your organization from cyber incidents?
[Word Count: 66]

To address each of these questions, this Guide lists a variety of free or low-cost tools, as 
well as procedures you can implement to improve your security. The list is not meant to be 
exhaustive, but it is representative of the wide variety of resources available at low/no cost 
that any SME can leverage to improve its cybersecurity.
[Word Count: 58]

To help you prioritize your efforts, this Guide recommends using a phased approach. Phase 
1 involves knowing what’s on your network and understanding your cybersecurity baseline. 
Phase 2 focuses on protecting your security baseline through education and prevention. 
Phase 3 helps your organization to prepare in advance for disruptive events.
[Word Count: 50]

Each phase has specific questions that you will want to answer, along with action items 
and tools that will help you achieve your goals. You may want to assign one person in your 
organization to be the cybersecurity leader to report regularly on security activities.
[Word Count: 45]

The first step that will help you move forward with your cybersecurity efforts is to know 
your network, including your connected devices, critical data, and software. Without a clear 
understanding of what you have to protect, you’ll have a hard time ensuring coverage of 
your cybersecurity efforts.
[Word Count: 47]

Here are a few key questions that are important to think about:
[Word Count: 12]

•	 Do you know what’s connected to your network?
•	 Do you know what software is installed?
•	 Do you know if your administrators and users are using strong passwords?
•	 Do you know which online platforms are being used by your employees (i.e., work 
productivity or chat tools)?
•	 Do you know where your most important data is stored on your network?
[Word Count: 63]

Know what’s connected to your environment
[Word Count: 6]

If your company data is lost, stolen, or corrupted, you could be put out of business. Accidents 
and natural events can potentially destroy the data you rely on for your business operations. 
Also, bad guys target data they can steal that has potential value to them. This could be 
external hackers or employees inside your company who want to steal your customers, credit 
card information, or intellectual property. Your network is the means to get the data they 
want to exploit.
[Word Count: 81]

To protect your business, you need to understand the value of your data and how it can be 
used. You may also be required by law to protect certain types information such as credit 
card and health information. Here are some examples of data you will want to identify  
and inventory:
[Word Count: 51]

•	 Credit card, banking, and financial information
•	 Personally identifiable information (PII), such as Social Security numbers, health 
information, usernames and passwords, home addresses, birth dates, etc.
•	 Customer lists, product lists, pricing, etc.
•	 Company trade secrets, formulas, methodologies, models, etc.
[Word Count: 42]

Know which devices are connected to your network
[Word Count: 8]

Multiple benefits result from having a good understanding of which devices are on  
your network. Your environment becomes easier to manage and you know what devices 
need to be protected. Below are some actions you can take to learn about the devices on 
your network.
[Word Count: 45]

CIS Controls Implementation Guide for SMEs
[Word Count: 6]

Phase 1: Know your environment continued
[Word Count: 6]

•	 Nmap: Famous multipurpose network scanner, used by system administrators  
and hackers across the world to identify which devices are connected to your network 
(https://nmap.org/)
•	 ZenMap: Easy-to-use graphic user interface for Nmap (https://nmap.org/zenmap/) 
•	 Spiceworks: Free IT inventory and asset management software to identify devices and 
software on your network (https://www.spiceworks.com/)
[Word Count: 52]

Managing software is a key component of both good IT management and effective 
cybersecurity. Rogue software within your environment can pose risks that must be 
mitigated, including legal liability for using unlicensed software. In addition, unpatched 
software is a common way for malware to infiltrate and attack your systems. By 
understanding what software is on your network, controlling individuals’ ability to add 
software to your network, and protecting accounts with administrative privileges, you’ll 
reduce both the likelihood and impact of cyber events.
[Word Count: 82]

•	 Create an inventory of applications that are running on your system and the web services 
or cloud solutions your organization uses:
[Word Count: 22]

◦◦Manually check the install/uninstall features of the operating system to get a list of 
software that has been installed on the system.
◦◦Periodically check to see what software is running on your systems using available 
inventory or auditing tools.
◦◦Check with your employees to identify which online services, such as online file-sharing 
platforms or HR systems, they are using as part of their job.
[Word Count: 64]

Phase 1: Know your environment continued
[Word Count: 6]

•	 Limit the number of individuals with administrator privileges to a very small number.  
Don’t allow general users to function as administrators.
•	 Use unique strong passwords for administrative accounts since admins have the ability to 
make system changes. Provide instructions for employees on developing strong passwords. 
•	 Ensure that system administrators use a separate non-administrative account for reading 
email, accessing the Internet, and composing documents. 
•	 Develop a company process for downloading software to your network, and prevent the 
use of non-approved applications via application whitelisting tools like Applocker.
[Word Count: 90]

As the old business saying goes, employees are your most valuable asset and that is true 
when it comes to security. Protecting your information requires not only technological 
solutions, but also employee awareness to prevent accidentally damaging your systems.  
This phase will focus on both protecting your computers and educating your users on their 
role in cybersecurity.
[Word Count: 57]

Here are some questions you’ll seek to answer:
[Word Count: 8]

•	 Do you set up your computers with security in mind?
•	 Does your network run up-to-date anti-malware software?
•	 Do you educate your users on cybersecurity best practices?
[Word Count: 29]

Malware and malicious cyber actors take advantage of either insecure configurations or 
vulnerabilities in the applications that are running on the system. To protect your company, 
you need to ensure that your operating system and applications (especially web browsers) 
are up-to-date and securely configured. In addition, you should identify and leverage the 
security and anti-malware functions that may be built-in to your operating system to help 
secure your environment. Examples include Windows Device Guard, Bitlocker, and others 
mentioned below.
[Word Count: 79]

Cybersecurity is not just about technology; it is also about process and people. Having only 
security tools and software isn’t sufficient. To help secure your organization, your employees 
and staff must also practice strong cybersecurity behaviors. There are two key considerations 
for “cyber securing” your staff: what you communicate and how you communicate.
[Word Count: 53]

CIS Controls Implementation Guide for SMEs
[Word Count: 6]

•	 Engage your employees at an emotional level, making sure they understand how to  
protect your organization and how this protection also applies to their personal lives.
•	 Be sure all staff understand that cybersecurity is an important part of their job.
•	 Disseminate to your staff free cybersecurity awareness materials, such as the SANS OUCH! 
newsletter and MS-ISAC’s monthly cyber-tip newsletters.
•	 Use online resources such as the National Cyber Security Alliance’s StaySafeOnline.org.

Once your organization has developed a strong cybersecurity foundation, you should build 
your capabilities for response. This includes the ability to know how to handle a cybersecurity 
incident and how to get back to business.
[Word Count: 35]

Here are key questions for you to answer:
[Word Count: 8]

•	 Do you know the last time your critical files were backed up?
•	 Do you periodically verify that the backups are complete?
•	 Do you know who to contact if an incident occurs?
[Word Count: 34]

Making and managing backups can be a tedious task; however, it is one of the best ways 
to secure your data, recover after an incident, and get your business back in order. This is 
especially crucial considering that ransomware malware can encrypt all your files and hold 
your data for ransom. A robust response plan, complemented by current and maintained 
backups, are the best protections when dealing with a cyber incident.
[Word Count: 71]

•	 Perform weekly backups of all computers that contain important information in an 
automated fashion. Consider using secure cloud solutions where available. 
•	 Periodically test your backups by trying to restore a system using a backup.
•	 Ensure that at least one backup destination is not accessible through the network.  
This will help protect against ransomware attacks since those backup files will not be 
accessible to the malware.
[Word Count: 68]

•	 Microsoft “Backup and Restore”: Backup utility tool installed on Microsoft® operating 
systems (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore)
•	 Apple Time Machine: Backup tool installed on Apple® operating systems

Phase 3: Prepare your organization continued
[Word Count: 6]

No one wants a cybersecurity incident to happen, but the better prepared you are, the better 
position you’ll be in to get your business back up and running. Cyber incidents include a 
denial-of-service attack that shuts down your website, a ransomware attack that locks up 
your system or your data, a malware attack that results in loss of your customer or employee 
data, and the theft of a laptop containing unencrypted data.
[Word Count: 72]

To be prepared, you need to know what resources are available in the event of an incident. 
You may be able to call on internal IT staff to help, or maybe you rely on a third party 
to provide incident management services. Either way, you should know the roles and 
expectations of anyone responsible for incident management before an event occurs.
[Word Count: 61]

•	 Identify those within your organization who will serve as the lead in case of an incident.
•	 Have contact information available for IT staff and/or third-party organizations.
•	 Join InfraGard or other associations that focus on sharing information and promoting 
cybersecurity.
•	 Keep a list of external contacts as part of your plan. These could include legal counsel, 
insurance agents if you carry cyber-risk coverage, and security consultants.
•	 Familiarize yourself with your state’s data breach notification laws.
[Word Count: 79]

•	 Consider contacting an IT or cybersecurity consultant if the nature and extent of the 
incident isn’t clear to you.
•	 Consider contacting legal counsel if it appears that personal information was involved  
in the incident.
•	 Prepare to notify any affected individuals whose personal information was involved  
in a breach.
•	 Inform law enforcement as needed.
