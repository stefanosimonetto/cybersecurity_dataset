Update: This attack seems to be restricted to 123-reg: www.123-reg.co.uk
The last couple of days, we’ve been seeing a good number of sites hacked with a familiar pattern. All of them have a javascript loading malware (the famous fake AV) from:

http://meqashopperinfo.com/js.php
http://meqashoppercom.com/js.php
http://meqashopperonline.com/js.php
http://www4.in-scale-feed.in

What’s interesting is that the domain is registered by the same people responsible for the previous attacks at Godaddy, Bluehost, etc: Hillary Kneber:
