Network up2date

We are releasing ASG Up2Date 7.506. The primary purpose of this release is to prepare V7 installations for the launch of our new Wireless Security solution.

As well, the ASG installations will receive some updated files for support of the next point-release of Astaro Command Center V2.2. We also take the opportunity to fix a few small bugs.
This will be pushed out via our Up2Date infrastructure, however if you would just like to manually download it you can do so here. Otherwise read on for the details.
This version is focused around introducing the necessary options and menu items for our new Wireless Security solution. There is a new WebAdmin section called "Wireless Security" which contains an overview and controls. More details on the public wireless beta and the products themselves will be made available shortly. Changes and updates were made to the Astaro Command Center agent as well to prepare it for the upcoming GA release of ACC V2.2.
