Network up2date UTM UTM 9.2 UTM 9.2 Accelerated

I am pleased to inform you that after a extended beta-period and also many thousand of customers already working with the soft-release version, today we have released Sophos UTM 9.2 to our Up2Date servers.
This major update to our UTM line introduces exciting new features like Advanced Threat protection, a new and intuitive Web Policy Management, Two-Factor-Authentication to name only a few and offers increased performance in throughput and reporting. Read on for download information, release notes, and all the details…

Below is the download links for the Up2Date from UTM 9.111. Also, we have started the automatic availability of the update to our Up2Date infrastructure in stages so you will start seeing the update package during the next weeks on WebAdmin. For a list of all the new features and functionality, you can download the official UTM 9.2 Release Notes. If you have a Sophos UTM Smart Installer, the new UTM 9.1 version will show up as a possible download using the provisioning software very soon (if it hasn’t updated already).
