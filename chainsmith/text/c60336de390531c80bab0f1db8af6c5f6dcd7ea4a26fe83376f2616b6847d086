“Want To Know Who’s Watching You?”
Here’s a site which we’ve seen on Facebook recently, located at
fb-szpieguj(dot)pl:

At first glance, it looks like every other Facebook “Profile Viewer” website out there. Here comes the Google Translate version of events:
Want to know who's watching you?
Thanks We are no longer a problem!
We guarantee 100% anonymity and satisfaction. Get a pair of binoculars

Check out the information below.
Give us a link to your profile.
Do not get scooped!

Security Guarantee!
Remember that you do not save your data. They are only needed for verification.
You do not have to be afraid, check out your profile!
You have to enter your Facebook profile in the box to continue, at which point this happens:

Telephone number? Where has my survey gone, you might ask? Well, this one is a mobile sign-up subscription service with up to 3 SMS sent your way a week. As it turns out, the “Want to know who is watching you” thing is surprisingly literal. Remember this from the above translation?
Get a pair of binoculars
It wasn’t a metaphor.

Yep, this website – framed with the visuals and language of a Facebook Profile Viewer – is an actual giveaway involving a set of binoculars, cranking the Meta scale right up to 11.
This webpage won’t let you know who visits your Facebook profile. It might let you see who visits your house assuming you win the top prize, but that’s about it…
