This is the second V4 ISO: asl-4.008.
It includes the released V4-Up2Dates 4.001-4.007 and some new features and bugfixes.

Remarks
This ISO adds support for AMD K6, Intel P1 and VIA C3 CPUs as well as modern boards with dual-CPU support and interrupt controller programming (APIC). It also updates all occurrences of glibc (security fix).
New/Changed/Improved
The new Linux kernel includes the security routing-cache-hash and TCP/IP fragment reassembly handling patch, the tty expolit patch, an ext3 bugfix, new modules for PPTP, drivers for NICs, support for the Toshiba-LCD and support for Compaq SmartArray 5 and Adaptec I2O RAID. The Pyramid LCD with enabled keyboard is supported. A new exim (SMTP-Proxy) is for a small AV-interaction bugfix also included.
We will use this ISO to build the 3.2->V4 Migration Package and the Up2Date 4.008 for existing 4.007 installations.
