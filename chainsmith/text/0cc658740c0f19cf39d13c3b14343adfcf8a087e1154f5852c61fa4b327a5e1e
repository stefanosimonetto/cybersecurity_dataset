Troubleshooting FreeBSD Wireless Problem

My main personal workstation is a Thinkpad x60s.  As I wrote in Triple-Boot Thinkpad x60s, I have Windows XP, Ubuntu Linux, and FreeBSD installed.  However, I rarely use the FreeBSD side.  I haven't run FreeBSD on the desktop for several years, but I like to keep FreeBSD on the laptop in case I encounter a situation on the road where I know how to solve a problem with FreeBSD but not Windows or Linux.  (Yes I know about [insert favorite VM product here].  I use them.  Sometimes there is no substitute for a bare-metal OS.)When I first installed FreeBSD on the x60s (named "neely" here), the wireless NIC, an Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG, was not supported on FreeBSD 6.2.  So, I used a wireless bridge.  That's how the situation stayed until I recently read M.C. Widerkrantz's FreeBSD 7.2 on the Lenovo Thinkpad X60s.  It looked easy enough to get the wireless NIC running now that it was supported by the wpi driver.  I had used freebsd-update to upgrade the 6.2 to 7.0, then 7.0 to 7.1, and finally 7.1 to 7.2.  This is where the apparent madness began.I couldn't find the if_wpi.ko or wpifw.ko kernel modules in /boot/kernel.  However, on another system (named "r200a") which I believe had started life as a FreeBSD 7.0 box (but now also ran 7.2), I found both missing kernel modules.  Taking a closer look, I simply counted the number of files on my laptop /boot/kernel and compared that list to the number of files on the other FreeBSD 7.2 system.$ wc -l boot-kernel-neely.06dec09a.txt     545 boot-kernel-neely.06dec09a.txt$ wc -l boot-kernel-r200a.06dec09a.txt    1135 boot-kernel-r200a.06dec09a.txtWow, that is a big difference.  Apparently, the upgrade process from 6.2 to 7.x did not bring almost 600 files, now present on a system that started life running 7.x.Since all I really cared about was getting wireless running on the laptop, I copied the missing kernel modules to /boot/kernel on the laptop.  I added the following to /boot/loader.conf:legal.intel_wpi.license_ack=1if_wpi_load="YES"After rebooting I was able to see the wpi0 device.wpi0:  mem 0xedf00000-0xedf00fff irq 17 at device 0.0 on pci3wpi0: Ethernet address: [my MAC]wpi0: [ITHREAD]wpi0: timeout resetting Tx ring 1wpi0: timeout resetting Tx ring 3wpi0: timeout resetting Tx ring 4wpi0: link state changed to UPI think I will try upgrading the 7.2 system to 8.0 using freebsd-update, then compare the results to a third system that started life as 7.0, then upgraded from 7.2 to 8.0.  If the /boot/kernel directories are still different, I might reinstall 8.0 on the laptop from media or the network.
