A currently ongoing spam campaign attempts to trick users into thinking that their ability to send Domestic Wire Transfers has been disabled. Impersonating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the cybercriminals behind the campaign are potentially earning thousands of dollars in the process of monetizing the anticipated traffic.
Once users click on the bogus ‘secure download link’, they’re automatically exposed to the client-side exploits served by the Black Hole Exploit Kit.

The following malicious domains also respond to the same IP:

We’ve already seen these domains used in previously profiled malicious campaigns:

Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 61bc6ad497c97c44b30dd4e5b3b02132 – detected by 2 out of 42 antivirus scanners as UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic.
Once executed, the sample phones back to hxxp://182.237.17.180:8080/DPNilBA/ue1elBAAAA/tlSHAAAAA/
We’ll continue monitoring the malicious activities of this group/individual, and post updates as soon as new activity takes place.
