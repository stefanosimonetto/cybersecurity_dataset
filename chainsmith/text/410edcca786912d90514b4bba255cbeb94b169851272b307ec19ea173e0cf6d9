Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) are a common target for cybercriminals. Throughout 2012, we intercepted several campaigns directly targeting CPAs in an attempt to trick them into clicking on the malicious links found in the emails. Once they click on any of the links, they’re automatically exposed to the client-side exploits served by the latest version of the Black Hole Exploit Kit.
In this post, I’ll analyze one of the most recently spamvertised campaigns impersonating the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, also known as AICPA.
More details:

Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

Second screenshot of the spamvertised email from the same campaign:

Sample subjects: Tax return assistance contrivance; Suspension of your CPA license; Revocation of your CPA license; Your accountant license can be end off; Your accountant CPA License Expiration
Email message: Valued AICPA participant, We have received a notice of your potential participation in income tax return infringement on behalf of one of your customers. According to AICPA Bylaw Section # 700 your Certified Public Accountant status can be cancelled in case of the event of presenting of a improper or fraudulent income tax return on the member’s or a client’s behalf. Please be informed of the complaint below and provide explanation of this issue to it within 7 days. The waiver to submit explanation within this period would abide in revokation of your CPA license.

Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 5b7aafd9ab99aa2ec0e879a24610844a – detected by 31 out of 45 antivirus scanners as Worm:Win32/Cridex.E.
Once executed, the sample performs the following actions:

Creates a batch script

Accesses Firefox’s Password Manager local database
Creates a thread in a remote process
Installs a program to run automatically at logon

It also drops the following MD5 on the affected hosts: MD5: 3e2df81077283e5c9d457bf688779773 – detected by 27 out of 45 antivirus scanners as PWS:Win32/Fareit.
It also phones back to the following C&C servers:
hxxp://69.64.89.82:8080/DPNilBA/ue1elBAAAA/tlSHAAAAA/
132.248.49.112
173.192.229.36
64.120.193.112
89.221.242.217
174.143.174.136
209.51.221.247
We’ve also seen and profiled the same IP (132.248.49.112) in multiple previously analyzed malware campaigns:

‘Fwd: Scan from a Xerox W. Pro’ themed emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit
Malicious ‘Security Update for Banking Accounts’ emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit
Bogus Facebook ‘pending notifications’ themed emails serve client-side exploits and malware

LocalXMM00000264
LocalXMQ426FB97F
LocalXMM000001D0
