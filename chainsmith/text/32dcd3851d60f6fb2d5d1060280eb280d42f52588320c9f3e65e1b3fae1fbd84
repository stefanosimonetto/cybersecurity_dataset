Updated 3R (RegRipper Ripper)
November 4, 2018 in 3R, Forensic Analysis, Software Releases

Itâ€™s been 2 years since I last updated the 3R so I decided to download the latest regripper repo (https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper2.8) and re-run my tool on it.
I had to do quick fix to handle the slack.pl script, but other than that, itâ€™s the same old 3r.pl script generating the very same content as before, except it now covers all the new plugins Harlan added over last 2 years â€“ if I am not wrong, there are over 40 new scripts. Kudos to Harlan for maintaining the repo for so many years.
So, there you have it, the Regripper is still here and kicking; if you ever need to write a new plug-in feel free to leverage the free online tool 3RPG, or, just learn perl ðŸ™‚
