I've encountered a problem running FreeBSD 6.0 as a guest OS in VMware Workstation 5.0.  I discovered the FreeBSD VM runs at half speed, such that 10 seconds of real time appears to be 5 or so seconds within the VM.  I tried installing the vmware-guestd port but that had no effect, even though it is running in the VM.  After reading this post, I tried changing this sysctl:gruden:/root# sysctl -a kern.timecounter.hardwarekern.timecounter.hardware: ACPI-fastgruden:/root# sysctl kern.timecounter.hardware=TSCkern.timecounter.hardware: ACPI-fast -> TSCThat had no effect.  This is my freebsd.vmx file:config.version = "8"virtualHW.version = "4"scsi0.present = "TRUE"scsi0.virtualDev = "lsilogic"memsize = "128"ide0:0.present = "TRUE"ide0:0.fileName = "FreeBSD-000003.vmdk"ide1:0.present = "TRUE"ide1:0.fileName = "auto detect"ide1:0.deviceType = "cdrom-raw"floppy0.fileName = "A:"ethernet0.present = "TRUE"usb.present = "FALSE"sound.present = "FALSE"sound.virtualDev = "es1371"displayName = "freebsd6-0_a"guestOS = "freebsd"nvram = "freebsd.nvram"sound.startConnected = "FALSE"usb.generic.autoconnect = "FALSE"floppy0.startConnected = "FALSE"ide0:0.redo = ""ethernet0.addressType = "generated"uuid.location = "56 4d 1e 0b c0 77 f6 f2-55 f3 38 5f 3a 47 3e b3"uuid.bios = "56 4d 1e 0b c0 77 f6 f2-55 f3 38 5f 3a 47 3e b3"tools.remindInstall = "FALSE"ethernet0.generatedAddress = "00:0c:29:47:3e:b3"ethernet0.generatedAddressOffset = "0"ide1:0.startConnected = "FALSE"tools.syncTime = "TRUE"Originally the file had the last variable appear thus:tools.syncTime = "FALSE"Either setting had no effect.  The host OS is Windows Server 2003 Enterprise x64 Edition SP1.  The weird part of this is that a FreeBSD 5.4 VM running within exactly the same parameters has no problem on this system.  This does not appear to be an isolated problem.Is anyone successfully running FreeBSD 6.0 within VMware Workstation?Update: I just copied a complete clone of this VM to my Windows 2000 Professional laptop running the same version of VMware Workstation.  (Yes, I have two licenses!)  :)  It made no difference.  The 5.5 RC2, VMware Workstation 5.5.0 build-18007, was no better with FreeBSD 6.0 as far as time goes.  However, the excessive beeping that I saw with FreeBSD 6.0 on VMware WS 5.0 was shortened considerable on WS 5.5.I just posted this story as a question to the VMTN forums.  I also posted to freebsd-emulation.
