Fake Picasa Mails Lead to Viagra Spam Sites
Fake Picasa emails are currently landing in mailboxes, which carry a message potentially irresistible to some even accounting for the “This is spam” flag. The below sample arrived around three hours ago:

“[Name], we chose your photo
Google Picasa
[Name],
We chose your photo
3 albums
17 photos”
Clicking the link redirects end-users to a Viagra spam page at
medicinewelnessveterinary(dot)com

As you can see, the above site has a lot of pill-themed neighbours. No matter how promising the message in a spam mail, always hover over the clickable link / button and see where you’re going to be taken in advance then Google it. There’s a good chance you’ll be able to confirm all of your “This is a mistake” suspicions. In this case, we’re going to have to wait for Picasa to recognise the skill apparent in our cat photos and selfies a little while longer…
