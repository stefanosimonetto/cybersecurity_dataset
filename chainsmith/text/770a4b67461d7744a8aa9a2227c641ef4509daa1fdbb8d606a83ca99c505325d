Affiliate networks are an inseparable part of the cybercrime ecosystem. Largely based on their win-win revenue sharing model, throughout the years, they’ve successfully established themselves as a crucial part of the cybercrime growth model, further ensuring that a cybercriminal will indeed receive a financial incentive for his fraudulent/malicious activities online.
From pharmaceutical affiliate networks, iPhone selling affiliate networks, to affiliate networks for pirated music and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) software, cybercriminals continue to professionally monetize each and every aspect of the underground marketplace, on their way to harness the experience, know-how and traffic acquisitions capabilities of fellow cybercriminals.
In this post, I’ll take a peek inside a cybercrime-friendly affiliate network for premium-rate SMS based mobile malware, list its associated numbers currently in use, provide MD5s of variants known to have been pushed by it, and discuss its business model.

Sample screenshots of the administration panel for a participant in the affiliate network for mobile malware:

What’s also worth emphasizing on next to the fact that everyone can join the affiliate network, is that the premium rate sms-sending mobile malware supports multiple operating systems, as it can expose users to .APK, .SIS and .JAR variants of the same mobile malware. The social engineering vectors of choice for the cybercriminals behind the affiliate network are as follows:

Fake Google Play mimicking the mobile version of the marketplace
Fake Adult themed videos
Fake Mobile Antivirus software
Two versions of a Fake Browser Security Update

Let’s discuss the ingenious from a scammer’s perspective ‘agreement’ that users who want to get access to the bogus/fraudulent content, automatically accept. First of all, the web sites participating in the affiliate network “assumes no responsibility for any direct or consequential loss arising from the use of the application , including loss of profits and losses“, and that’s just for starters. Whenever a socially engineered user attempts to install the rogue applications, the initial SMS he/she will send automatically results in a subscription to the service, with the rogue applications sending premium-rate SMS messages in the background.
