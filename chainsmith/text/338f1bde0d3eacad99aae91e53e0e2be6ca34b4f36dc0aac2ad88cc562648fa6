Avoid This Fake MH17 Missile Video Page
Just a short heads up to say that there’s another fake Malaysian Airlines disaster page to add to the growing collection, located at
newvdoapps(dot)asia/mh17/index(dot)php
and is looking to exploit the MH17 tragedy with claims of non-existent missile video footage.

Clicking the supposed clip and performing the “Share this video on Facebook to watch it” steps took us to various Potentially Unwanted Program installs.

These types of incredibly distasteful scam pages will be with us for a while yet. Don’t fall for it…
