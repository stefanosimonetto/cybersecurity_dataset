We just made available a new ACC BETA release 1.980 based on our Beta tester feedback and our own testing so far during this beta. Read on for a short announcement. This release keeps us on track for ACC 2.000 being generally available during the 3rd week of March if the schedule proceeds as planned.

You can see our previous announcement for all the BETA details. This Up2Date 1.980 is a bug fix and progression release based on the feedback of our testing community which enhances the stability and performance of the Astaro Command Center BETA. We have 3 packages which are available to you, which can be used to update your existing BETA installation with 1.980, install 1.980 fresh from a full ISO image, or move your existing 1.903 stable version into the BETA 1.950 (use with caution!).

An Important Word about BETA Releases
We realize many features of this upcoming release are things you may be eagerly awaiting. While we do love to have as many users and installations as possible testing and providing feedback, in environments where uptime is crucial, consider that BETA releases can contain severe bugs and otherwise cause operational concerns! Most importantly, BETA versions are not reliable indicators of the final quality/stability of a formal, general release version. All Up2Dates are GNUPG-signed!
