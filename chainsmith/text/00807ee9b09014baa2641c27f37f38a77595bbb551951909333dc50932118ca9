Be Careful on your (Digital) Travels
If you were planning on visiting Bogor at, er, Visitbogor(dot)com you may want to leave your online passport at home until the site owners fix a bump in the itinerary. Namely: a webpage defacement bearing shout-outs to various hacker crews and individuals.
In 2010, Bogor was voted as the most attractive tourist destination in Indonesia so it has a fair bit of pulling power both online and off. Here’s the defacement:

There’s supposed to be a background image and a YouTube video embedded in the page, but they don’t seem to want to load.
There’s no malware or exploits being served up, so that’s something – but as with all compromised websites, there’s always the possibility of somebody coming along afterwards and making edits of a more malicious nature.

Hacked websites in general are a goldmine for scammers, and everybody is a target – the bigger the name, the better.
You can always visit the Official Bogor page in the meantime until the defacement on the increasingly popular VisitBogor site is cleaned up – and don’t forget to check out our list of travel tips to keep you safe on your wanderings.
