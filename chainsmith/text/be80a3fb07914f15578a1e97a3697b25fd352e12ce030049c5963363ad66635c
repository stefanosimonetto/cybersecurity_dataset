Today I received a CD from Convention CDs, the company that recorded my presentation at RSA 2006 last month.  The company Web site is basically blank, but if you want to order a copy of my talk "Traffic-Centric Incident Response and Forensics" you can send email to sales at conventioncds dot com.  My CD bears number CD 94-2006, which may be its product number.  I get no compensation from these CDs.I needed a way to listen to the CD in FreeBSD, so I decided to go a low-impact approach and use xmcd.  I could not find a precompiled package, but after adding the packages needed for building the port I found the port a quick build.  I had to run the following configuration routine before I could listen to CDs.# /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xmcd/config/config.shXmcd version 3.3.2 Configuration ProgramSetting up for host: orr.taosecurity.com----------------------------------------*** CDDB(R) ACCESS CONFIGURATION ***If your system has Internet connectivity and functionaldomain name service (DNS), you should answer 'y' to the nextquestion.  If this system is not linked to the Internet at all,then answer 'n'.  Would you like to use the free Internet CDDB(R) service  for album/track information? [y] nInternet CDDB server access is disabled.To enable it later, run the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xmcd/config/config.shscript again.*** DRIVE CONFIGURATION ***Configuring drive 0...  Does this drive use a SCSI interface? [n] n  Non-SCSI drives are currently supported only on the  following platforms:        BSDI/WindRiver BSD/OS        Compaq/HP Tru64 UNIX, Digital UNIX        FreeBSD        HP-UX        IBM AIX        Linux        NetBSD        OpenBSD        QNX        SCO Open Server        Sun Solaris  Do you want to continue? [y] y  Are you using the SCSI Emulation (ATAPI-CAM) interface? [n]   Enter device path: [/dev/acd0]   Please select a Device Interface Method:  1.    SunOS/Solaris/Linux/QNX ioctl method  2.

Does this drive have a non-standard block size? [n]   The configuration disables these features:  - The channel routing control.  The CDDA configuration has been set as follows:  - Extraction: FreeBSD ioctl  - Playback:   Open Sound System (OSS)  Creating the /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xmcd/config/acd0 file...  Do you have more CD drives on your system? [n] Xmcd set-up is now complete.Please read the DRIVES file supplied with the xmcddistribution for hardware configuration informationabout specific drives.That was it.  I can listen to audio CDs on FreeBSD now.
