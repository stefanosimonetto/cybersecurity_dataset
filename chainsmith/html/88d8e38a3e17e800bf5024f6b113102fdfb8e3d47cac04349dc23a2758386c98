The ever-growing hordes of <em class="productname">Linux</em> and open-source aficionados continue to revel in the relative impenetrability of their security model and in the scant attention paid to them by malware creators. Why, I am asked on what seems like a daily basis, would I want to run anti-virus on my <em class="productname">Linux</em> box? What have I to fear? A tiny handful of malware with puny penetration levels is surely a risk worth taking, runs the standard argument.</p><p>Of course, this is quite beside the point; while <em class="productname">Linux</em> as a desktop operating system continues to nurture its small, but generally keen and committed user base, it is when running on a server that it is really at home, continuing to dominate at gateways and scattered throughout corporate and academic networks. Fileserver systems, with their arrays of <em class="productname">Windows</em> clients storing and transferring all manner of things thanks to the delights of <em class="productname">Samba</em>, can be nasty breeding grounds for network-wide malware infestations if they are not properly protected. However, they can also be used as effective blockades, preventing malicious code from being passed to new targets. Even where desktops feature their own anti-malware systems, corporate policies often (rightly) insist on thorough regimes of protection with no system allowed to operate without malware scanning, no matter how secure it may seem. For this reason, the <em class="productname">Linux</em> VB100 generates a great deal of interest from our readers in the corporate world, who are not above demanding tests on far more esoteric platforms.</p><p><em class="productname">Ubuntu Linux</em> is a relative newcomer to the scene compared to the likes of <em class="productname">SUSE</em> and <em class="productname">Red Hat</em>, the even more venerable <em class="productname">Slackware</em> and, of course, <em class="productname">Debian</em>, from which <em class="productname">Ubuntu</em> evolved. The distribution&rsquo;s first release was in 2004, and since then it has seen massive growth, with strong financial backing through its links to <em class="phrase">Canonical Ltd</em> and its entrepreneur founder Mark Shuttleworth, the first African to venture into space.</p><p><em class="productname">Ubuntu</em> has shied away from the duality of commercial and free versions adopted by other big-money distros, and embraced the open-source philosophy wholeheartedly. Accompanied by numerous offshoot projects focusing on specific desktops systems and user groups, <em class="productname">Ubuntu</em>&rsquo;s focus on friendly usability, stability and consistent updating has brought strong penetration of desktops &ndash; a poll held last summer found over 30% of respondents were using it, with its nearest rival, <em class="productname">OpenSUSE</em>, at 19% and <em class="productname">Debian</em> at 11%. At the server level fewer details are available, but the server edition seemed more appropriate to our purposes; of course this selection brought with it the likelihood of some compromises in usability, with any cuddly ease of use likely to have been stripped away in favour of efficiency, security and robustness.</p><p>The challenge of learning a new platform should, I hoped, be somewhat mitigated by the fairly small number of entries this month &ndash; a mere 15 products providing a relatively easy ride between the mammoth <em class="productname">Vista</em> test last time around and what is likely to be an even more gargantuan array of products in the <em class="productname">XP</em> test scheduled to take place later in the summer. Looking forward to simple command-line interfaces providing easy access to configuration options, I burned the install image, dusted off my rather neglected <em class="productname">Linux</em> skills, and ventured bravely into the lab.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3810413"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p>Installation of <em class="productname">Ubuntu</em> was a pretty straightforward process, guided by a pleasant graphical setup process. As usual in VB100 testing I tried to keep things as simple as possible, sticking to the default settings to get as close as possible to an out-of-the-box setup. Of course this policy couldn&rsquo;t be applied perfectly, with some stages such as disk partitioning requiring specific tuning for my needs, but the final setup provided the basic <em class="productname">Ubuntu</em> fileserver. As expected, this didn&rsquo;t include a desktop environment, so those products with attractive interfaces would not have their full range of offerings investigated, but the command-line style is generally preferred at the server level anyway, with a minimum of &lsquo;magic&rsquo; going on to open potential security holes and drain resources. </p><p>Less expected was the absence of other useful items, including an NFS implementation, but a little investigation showed that a large range of extra goodies were available on the install CD. Beyond a few basic steps such as configuring networking, connecting to the lab servers and client systems and copying test samples to the local machines, very little further work was required before taking snapshot images and getting down to business. In the previous <em class="productname">Linux</em> test (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2007/04/vb-comparative-review-novell-suse-linux-enterprise-server-10
" target="_top">VB, April 2007, p.11</a>) a copy of <em class="productname">dazuko</em>, the open-source file-hooking software used by many <em class="productname">Linux</em> products, was prepared on the test machines in advance, but in this case one of the submissions had thoughtfully included a pre-built binary so this step was not necessary (although I had little doubt that some compilation would eventually be required).</p><p>Client systems were also prepared, using a standard <em class="productname">Windows XP SP2</em> image with the <em class="productname">Samba</em> shares of the test servers mapped, with all on-access tests planned to be run from these. To avoid unfairness, network activity was kept to a minimum during the tests, which were run one at a time to further reduce the possibility of unequal treatment.</p><p>The test sets were aligned with the March 2008 WildList, which was released a few weeks prior to the test set deadline of 2 May and the product submission deadline of 5 May. The latest WildList included a fairly large number of new additions, but these were concentrated in a few families &ndash; most notably a large swathe of W32/OnlineGames trojans, showing further evolution of the WildList into the cybercrime-ridden modern world. Quite a few older items fell from the list, including several strains of W32/Mytob and W32/MyDoom, and also the veteran W32/Nimda, which finally dropped off the list after a marathon stint of officially being in the wild.</p><p>My attendance of numerous meetings and conferences this month hampered any efforts to expand the other test sets by more than a minimal amount, with only a handful of items added to the clean and infected sets and the meagre set of <em class="productname">Linux</em> samples dusted off. The most significant addition was the insertion of a set of <em class="productname">Linux</em> files into the clean set, to form an extra part of the speed measurements. This time the samples were taken from a separate system from those running the tests, one which had been in heavy use for some time and thus held a more eclectic range of items. The entire contents of /bin, /sbin, /etc and /opt were included, making the new set on a par with the others in terms of size on disk, but considerably ahead of them in the number of files it contained.</p><p>Finally, the standard archive test set consisted of the EICAR test file embedded in a selection of archive types at a range of depths. These would, as usual, be scanned with the default settings and with &lsquo;all files&rsquo; and &lsquo;scan archives&rsquo; settings enabled where possible, and detection at a depth of five or more levels on at least half of the set would be considered adequate for a product&rsquo;s inclusion in the full archive graphs. With everything ready to go, it was time to see how the selection of products fared.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4318263"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3198428"></a>Alwil avast! for Linux 3.1.0</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Alwil</em>&rsquo;s product arrived as several archive files, which when unpacked were found to contain simple installer scripts which did all the work of setting things up very nicely. However, the on-access component was a little less straightforward &ndash; it needed some compilation and access to the dazuko sources, which caused a headache and required calls to the developers for advice as the various requisites were set up. The libdazuko library, not built by default by the standard setup process, was also needed, but when at last everything was in place testing proceeded without further incident. Configuration, both of the command-line scanner and the on-access components, operated in a straightforward and standard fashion, with ample documentation available to guide the novice user.</p><p>Scanning speeds were about what I should have expected, my hopes of seeing testing times cut drastically as a result of using a pared-down operating system having quickly been dashed. On-access scanning speeds in particular were somewhat slower than I had hoped, doubtless due in large part to the test being run across the network. <em class="productname">Avast!</em>&rsquo;s detection rates were little changed from previous tests, although detection for the single file-infector on the WildList which was missed last time around was added and the core set was covered without problems.</p><p>In the clean sets, however, a couple of items were mislabelled as malware, including one which has tripped up a series of products in the past year, and thus <em class="phrase">Alwil</em> will have to wait a little longer before reclaiming its place on the VB100 podium.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Linux: </span></strong>96.67%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Standard: </span></strong>%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>87.13%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4525646"></a>AVG Anti-Virus 7.5.51</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AVG</em>&rsquo;s product was considerably simpler to install, coming as a single .deb installer package which set everything up in a few moments, the majority of which were spent entering a licence key. Again using the <em class="productname">dazuko</em> file-hooking system, this time all the installer required was the kernel module to be in place. The design conformed to <em class="productname">Linux</em> norms, with straightforward syntax to the command-line scanner and the configuration files for the on-access monitor. Guidance and information was also ample and properly implemented.</p><p>Speeds were a little disappointing, even more so with scanning of all files and archives enabled, but detection rates were good, with no WildList samples missed and no false positives raised, and thus <em class="phrase">AVG</em> earns a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Linux: </span></strong>88.33%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Standard: </span></strong>%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>73.89%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4581427"></a>Avira AntiVir for Linux 2.1.12-31</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Avira</em> developed the <em class="productname">dazuko</em> system and continues to fund its maintenance and development. It is not surprising, therefore, that the company&rsquo;s product is among those making use of the file-hooking software.</p><p>The installation setup came as an archive file containing an install script, as well as the pre-built dazuko module &ndash; I suspect this addition is not generally provided for customers, but many <em class="productname">Linux</em> distributions come with the binary package available. The installer offered the delights of centralized management systems and graphical interfaces, which I was forced to turn down, and again the design, settings and documentation were excellent.</p><p>Scanning speeds this time were a little more impressive, and once again detection rates were superb, with most of the missed items merely being the result of rare file types not being scanned with the default settings. With flawless coverage of the WildList and not a hint of a false positive, <em class="phrase">Avira</em> easily qualifies for a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Linux: </span></strong>66.67%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Standard: </span></strong>%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>100.00%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4411195"></a>BitDefender Security for Linux 3.0.0.80505</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">BitDefender</em>&rsquo;s product was another using the .deb system, this time with a built-in installation system too. This caused some issues initially as older versions of C++ libraries were required, which in turn required the installation of several other dependencies. Presumably on a fully networked system this would all have been handled by the package manager, reaching out to the web for any requirements.</p><p>Once over these hurdles things went very easily however, with a <em class="productname">Samba</em> VFS module used for the on-access component &ndash; this was the standard alternative to the <em class="productname">dazuko</em> system in the last <em class="productname">Linux</em> test and its operation proved simple, with a small change to the <em class="productname">Samba</em> configuration to point it at the new scanning object the only requirement.</p><p>In the previous <em class="productname">Linux</em> test several products using the VFS method encountered difficulties with speed and stability, but there were no such issues here, with things running along at excellent speeds without so much as a wobble until on-demand scanning of the archive set brought up a few segmentation-fault crashes. A handful of items were removed and the test was completed successfully, and the issue could not be reproduced in isolation.

A GUI is also available, for those hedonists running glitzy desktop environments, but the command line served ably once its intricacies had been mastered.</p><p>The product lived up to its name with its scanning speeds, which were helped in the on-access test by not scanning archives by default. Upon investigating this, I found various options for the configuration of on-access logs and other sundries, but little concerning the actual types of files scanned.

Searching inside the pair of archives provided I found a selection of .deb packages and some documentation in PDF files, which were shipped over to the workstation for some in-depth browsing. Eventually, after a few false starts thanks to conflicting instructions at different points, things were up and running pretty solidly.</p><p>Next came the equally arduous task of navigating my way around the product, which was carried out mostly by means of passing arguments to the &lsquo;sav&rsquo; command, which would then silently be followed by the scanning and monitoring daemons. This made monitoring the progress of scans rather tricky, having to rely mainly on watching the tail of the syslog &ndash; the only logging method available as far as I could tell &ndash; and keeping an eye on the hard drive activity lights.</p><p>On-access monitoring defaults to removing or disinfecting files, so to speed things along I delved bravely into the full glory of the configuration system, digging up secrets gleaned from tech support gurus for the last test. A listing of the configuration settings, which take the form of a registry-style database of keys, provided a little illumination, but its true meanings were far from clear. Passing in commands proved a lengthy and difficult process. Building up huge commands to pass in simple changes and an absence of feedback to confirm an instruction had been accepted, required repeated trawls through the data to check changes had indeed occurred.</p><p>Once everything was under control, things moved along nicely, with excellent scanning speeds and the usual impeccable detection. Archive settings were a little low to measure fairly against others on the speed graphs, but changing them would have required more visits to the config system, and the resultant wear and tear on keyboards would have eaten heavily into my hardware budget.

Once again, however, the test&rsquo;s strict false positive rules played a major part, with just four files scuppering the chances of a VB100 award for six of the products.</p><p>Beyond the basics of the scores, the products themselves displayed a dizzying variation in style and implementation, with some remaining extremely simple while others have expanded their functionality in a range of new ways. Both paths proved capable of providing stable, rapid and usable products as well as confusing, sluggish and wobbly protection, with documentation &ndash; or at least accessing it &ndash; being the most significant factor as far as ease of use was concerned. Of course, submissions were not necessarily made in the same format as paying customers would receive, and the likelihood of more obvious installation instructions and user manuals would make a big difference in some cases. With a little work, however, all products were made to function sufficiently well to get through the tests, and all provided a decent level of configurability, albeit in some cases in a rather bizarre and arcane fashion.</p><p>The added complexity of the installation and navigation of various products meant that this month&rsquo;s comparative was not the quick and restful experience I had hoped for between two much larger tests.
