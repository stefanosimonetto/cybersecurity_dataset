Earlier this week, HP’s Software Security Response Team issued a security bulletin, alerting users that certain HP ProCurve 5400 zl switches were shipped with malware installed on the associated compact flash cards. No details were given about the type of malware shipped to unaware customers.

More details on the affected switches, including their serial numbers:

A potential security vulnerability has been identified with certain HP ProCurve 5400 zl switches containing compact flash cards which may be infected with a virus. Reuse of an infected compact flash card in a personal computer could result in a compromise of that system’s integrity.
Affected switches and their associated serial numbers are as follows:

J9532A 5412zl-92GG-PoE+ / 2XG SFP+ v2 Switch
J9533A 5406zl-44G-PoE+ / 2XG SFP+ v2 Switch

HP isn’t the first company to ship Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) hardware. Moreover, in 2008, the company once again shipped hardware with malicious software — W32.Fakerecy and W32.SillyFDC — on it, this time it was infected 256K / 1GB USB Drives.
These incidents are  the result of a flawed quality assurance process, allowing cybercriminals an even deeper penetration in a company’s supply chain.
End and corporate users are advised to check whether their HP switch is malware-infected, and to follow the steps presented in the security bulletin in order to mitigate the risk posed by the infected compact flash cards.
