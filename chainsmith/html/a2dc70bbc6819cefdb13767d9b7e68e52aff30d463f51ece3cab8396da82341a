As the release of its replacement (<em class="productname">Windows 7</em>) approaches fast, little nostalgia has accumulated for the platform, with the user base still barely troubling its aging predecessor <em class="productname">XP</em>. Most estimates put <em class="productname">Vista</em> on fewer than 30% of desktops, with <em class="productname">XP</em> holding onto more than 60% of the marketplace some eight years after its release and a year after the first stages of its withdrawal from sale. Popular opinion continues to belittle <em class="productname">Vista</em>&rsquo;s accomplishments and most would-be upgraders seem content to wait for the new and improved version 7, due in just a few months&rsquo; time.</p><p>Our own previous experiences with the platform have done little to endear it to us, and presumably the developers of most anti-malware solutions have similar feelings, given the oddities, instabilities and general bizarreness we&rsquo;ve seen on the platform in previous tests. We expected to see more of the same this time around, and hope that the advent of a replacement will mean not too many more comparatives on <em class="productname">Vista</em> will be necessary. The arrival of a new service pack promised to bring a new level of unpredictability to the mix, with the added stability it was designed to provide counterbalanced by the likelihood of a whole new range of horrors.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3036056"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p>Installing and preparing the test systems was a little less unpleasant this time thanks to a little experience, with many of the pitfalls &ndash; such as the tendency to go into deep sleep in the middle of an overnight scan &ndash; circumvented at an early stage. Applying the new service pack proved unproblematic, if rather long-winded, and the systems did seem more stable than on previous occasions. As usual, our Luddite tendencies led us to disable most of the funky graphical stylings and revert settings to the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; style where possible, but the UAC system was left intact to monitor how well various products were integrated with it, knowing full well that in some cases it would produce numerous intrusions and in a few it might need to be disabled completely.</p><p>Several of the products submitted were unable to comply with our request for offline updating, so in addition to snapshots of the bare test system several others were taken on the deadline date with installed and updated products in situ, thus allowing them to be tested on a level field with the others.</p><p>The deadline for product submission was set for 24 June, which proved a more than usually busy day thanks to the extra tasks of installing products, connecting them to the web for updates and taking snapshots. We were relieved that the field of entrants was not as enormous as it might have been, with several of the occasional entrants of recent tests failing to turn up and some prospective newcomers deciding at the last minute that they were not quite ready to dip their corporate toes into the often chilly waters of the VB100. In the end a total of 37 products were entered for the test, but as in previous tests we reserved the right to exclude any which proved intractable or uncooperative, to allow enough time to test as many products as possible.</p><p>A measure taken for the first time this month has been to impose a nominal charge for multiple entries from the same vendor. We have no intention of breaking with the VB100 tradition of being free and open to all comers, but in recent tests a number of vendors have opted to submit multiple products, which has added significantly to the growing burden of testing. To avoid passing on to our readers the additional costs (in terms of hardware, space and manpower) of the ever-increasing field of competitors, we have opted to impose a per-product fee on the third and subsequent submissions from any single vendor (any vendor may submit up to two products to each test free of charge, a nominal fee will be charged for each product that exceeds this number). This month just one vendor chose to enter three separate products and was duly requested to contribute to our running costs, but of course this was not allowed to influence our treatment of the product in any way, either in the opinions given in the write-up or in the results collected from it.</p><p>With the test systems prepared and the field of products gathered, the final stage of set-up was the compilation of the test sets, which as usual since the introduction of our RAP testing system was not completed until a week after the deadline for product submissions. The bulk of our test sets were already frozen, with the standard test set deadline set a few days prior to the product deadline, on 20 June. The May 2009 WildList was released a few days prior to this date, and was thus used as the basis for our core certification set. The list was remarkable for the large number of new items included, dominated as many recent lists have been by online gaming password-stealers. Of most note in the list were a handful of samples of Conficker (aka Downadup), whose headline-grabbing days seem well in the past now, along with some social network targeting items such as W32/Koobface. Of most interest to us, however, was the addition of a genuine and by all accounts highly tricky file-infecting virus &ndash; one of many sub-strains of the W32/Virut family which have caused a number of problems for major products in the past. With the ongoing development of our automated systems, we were able to include fairly large numbers of replicated samples in the test set. This meant that a list containing 677 items was represented by over 3,000 unique samples. As usual, percentages presented in the results tables are based on per-variant detections, rather than per sample, with the 2,500-odd Virut samples counted as a group with the same weighting as a single sample of the other entries, hence the rather fine percentage margins in some cases.</p><p>The growth in size was also seen elsewhere, with similarly large numbers of Virut samples added to the polymorphic set to represent some of the other sub-strains emerging in recent months. The RAP sets were compiled in the weeks leading up to and the week following the product submission deadline, and as usual fluctuated in size somewhat thanks to the unpredictable flow of samples into our various feeds. The trojan set was compiled from similar sources in the month or so prior to the RAP start date.</p><p>The greatest addition to the test sets this month was to the clean sets, with several hundred thousand new samples making their appearance this month after an ambitious period of sample gathering. The bulk of the samples came from well-known and widely used software brands and products, as part of a project to reorganize our clean sets by significance. While we expected few new false positives to emerge, it was of course impossible to rule out major and embarrassing slip-ups by some. We anticipated that the main impact of the enlargement of the set would be seen in scanning time and stability issues.</p><p>With all this squeezed onto the test systems, we prepared to shut ourselves away in the test lab, unlikely to see the sun for some time and with the prospect of a long and difficult month ahead.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3493468"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2313497"></a>Agnitum Outpost Security Suite Pro 6.5.5</h3></div></div></div><p>First on the roster, <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em>&rsquo;s suite product is nice and thorough, and as such has a rather slow installation process, which somewhat unusually creates a restore point before it gets underway. The interface is nicely designed and clear, but gives little space to the anti-malware component in amongst the various other modules and so provides fairly little by way of user configuration. Running tests proved fairly unproblematic, but at one point, during on-access scanning of clean files, a nasty crash complete with blue screen was observed. With care, the tests were completed however.</p><p>Detection rates proved pretty impressive, with a fairly steep drop in the +1 week of the RAP sets mitigated by some comfortingly even scores in the reactive portion, making for a strong overall average. Coverage of the large number of new Virut samples was impeccable, and the WildList was detected without issues, but in the clean sets a single file from the large swathe of new additions was alerted on as a trojan. The detection was recognizable to the practised eye as packer-based, but as the file is included with a recent version of <em class="phrase">Microsoft</em>&rsquo;s .NET framework &ndash; something which labs really should be tracking as part of their false positive mitigation regime &ndash; this was considered enough to deny <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em> a VB100 this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/Agnitum-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>87.48%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.71%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>89.99%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>1</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4099327"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4099334"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3353566"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3555256"></a>AhnLab V3 Internet Security 8.0.0.2</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AhnLab</em>&rsquo;s product has had something of an overhaul since we last looked at it, and presents a clean and appealing interface with a speedy installation process needing no reboot to complete. The interface has a few quirks of layout and also a few stability issues under heavy fire, suffering some lengthy freezes after longer scans and on-access runs. Logging also proved somewhat tricky, as the log viewer utility seemed unable to cope with large logs, spending some time trying to refresh its listings but eventually giving up. On a couple of occasions we also observed the test machine mysteriously shutting down during a long scan, which we attributed to overheating. To complete testing some of the test sets had to be broken up into smaller chunks to ensure they ran to the end and to enable accurate collection of data.</p><p>Scanning speeds were pretty decent though, and the interface generally proved simple to use and responsive, so testing completed in reasonable time despite the extra steps required. Although a fair number of samples of recent W32/Virut strains were missed, the specific variant included in the WildList set was handled without difficulty, and with no other misses and no false positives, <em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> earns the first VB100 award of this month&rsquo;s batch.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/AhnLab-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>87.49%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.89%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.58%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2675406"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3202545"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2113228"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3990770"></a>Alwil avast!

A major new version is due sometime soon, and we look forward to the opportunity of taking a look at it in the coming months. For now, the installation process remains fast and simple, with a reboot not specifically required but recommended in case of problems. The advanced interface required for much of our testing still has a tree layout with some oddities of its own, which we found somewhat confusing despite much practice, and which continues to have a few issues during longer scans: a lack of refreshing leaves useful data invisible and inaccessible until the end of a scan.</p><p>Detection rates were pretty strong, not quite up to the excellent standards achieved in recent months, at least on the more recent samples in the RAP sets, but still good, with an overall average of 74% in the RAP test.

The offer of a toolbar somewhat dampened our enthusiasm, but its recommended rather than enforced nature made up for this a little. At the end of the rather sluggish install, a &lsquo;first run wizard&rsquo; leads through some initial set-up steps for the various components, and once finally through to the main interface with its multiple module/icon layout we found it fairly intuitive to use, if a little over complicated in places.

At the end of the scan, <span class="emphasis"><em>whether or not installed spyware is found on the machine</em></span> (and indeed on other occasions, such as when attempting to disable the anti-spyware component) a pop?up appears, informing the user that unidentified, non?specific &lsquo;threats&rsquo; have been discovered on the machine, which can only be removed by a fully licensed version of the product.

Warning messages about unsigned drivers during installation also returned with a vengeance thanks to the UAC system, which had to be disabled to allow the install to complete properly.

Some other issues emerged with the UAC interaction, including the requirement to be running as admin to access some system files, which resulted in a standard scan of the C drive halting halfway through.

The install is surprisingly quick considering the number of components included, and requires a reboot to complete. The layout is fairly simple to navigate, and has a nice quirky but unfussy look and feel. The thoroughness of the detection took rather a heavy toll on our test systems, which seemed to wear out quite quickly and on a few occasions shut themselves down unexpectedly. We also noted a few issues with the product itself, which seemed to lose touch with its controls, the &lsquo;scan target&rsquo; button regularly failing to bring up the required dialog if clicked on too soon after the completion of a scan. The thoroughness of the standard settings led to some rather slow scanning speeds, but on access, rather surprisingly, the product relies on file extensions to determine what to scan.</p><p>With the speed tests handled, the infected sets proved more difficult thanks to the rather shaky logging that has been mentioned in the past. This seemed less serious an issue this time though, and complete logs were obtained with only minimal moderation of scan sizes, with reboots in between scans used to circumvent the issue of the failing scan button. The final results showed a handful of samples of recent Virut variants missed in the polymorphic set, but no problems with the WildList strain. Detection rates overall were excellent, with a pretty decent showing in the RAP sets, and with no false positives either <em class="phrase">F-Secure</em> earns a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/F-Secure-CS-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>94.92%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.998%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4222904"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2569796"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3987130"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2547923"></a>F-Secure PSB Workstation Security 8.00 build 245</h3></div></div></div><p>This is a more corporate-oriented version of the <em class="phrase">F-Secure</em> product, &lsquo;<em class="productname">PSB</em>&rsquo; standing for &lsquo;<em class="productname">Protection Services for Business</em>&rsquo;.

The interface is curvy and colourful and fairly appealing at first sight, but navigation through what appears to be a wealth of options proved to be extremely difficult and rather disappointing &ndash; many of the controls we would have liked were either absent or too well hidden for the likes of us to discover. Problems with the destruction of our samples as well as some quirky on-access behaviour were overcome by careful analysis, sneaky workarounds and appeals to the developers for assistance.

Thankfully, full and reliable logging is buried in the product&rsquo;s file structure, in a folder which <em class="productname">Vista</em> warned we should not be probing into but which was found thanks to some tips received from the developers. Parsing these showed some superb detection rates, continuing a long-term upward trend in the product&rsquo;s prowess, with the RAP week +1 detection particularly noteworthy as the highest of any product tested this month. The WildList was handled without problems, although once again a fair number of the additional Virut sub-strains added to our polymorphic set this month were missed.

The current version has a nice simple install process, which somehow feels a little old-fashioned next to some of the super-slick products appearing of late, and produces a few unexpected pop-ups of unpredictable appearance during the process, as well as lingering for several minutes at the &lsquo;finishing&rsquo; stage.</p><p>Once up and running though, things are nicely laid out and simple to navigate, with a decent level of options.

With no English translation, we used the standard Japanese-language product &ndash; with a user guide kindly provided by the developers and a Kanji dictionary to hand to look up any troublesome words in the interface. Unable to provide an offline updater, we were forced to install the product on the deadline date, update and take a snapshot for later transfer to the test systems, but this proved no big deal, with a smooth and easy installation and a fast, straightforward update process.</p><p>The main interface is quite attractive, and is a little unusual compared to much of the rest of the market, but this is of little surprise. Even with the Japanese characters only partially rendered on our English-language systems it seemed fairly simple to navigate based on recognition of standard iconography and a basic if rather rusty understanding of the writing system. Logging is fairly minimal by default, but a simple registry tweak provides more detailed records to be passed to the event log, from where the required information was gathered without difficulty. The product is based on the Kaspersky engine, and thus, as one would expect, provides an excellent level of detection across the board, along with some impressive stability under pressure, although the thoroughness is naturally tempered by some rather slow scanning speeds and perhaps less than ideal on-access overheads. With no problems encountered in any of the test sets, the <em class="phrase">Nifty Corporation</em> takes away a VB100 award at its first attempt, and we look forward to its return.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/Nifty-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>95.21%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.998%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3619082"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3619090"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3684836"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4925522"></a>Norman Security Suite 7.10</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Norman</em>&rsquo;s current suite installs rapidly and easily, with the only tricky question during the process being whether or not to enable the &lsquo;Screen saver scanner&rsquo;, designed to run a scan when the system is idle. Although on by default, we opted to disable this in case it interrupted our normal testing. The end of the process suggests that a reboot may be necessary once the attempt to update has completed. This was indeed the case, with a small and rather subtle pop-up prompting for the restart a minute or two after the install proper was done.</p><p>The interface itself greatly resembles that of the <em class="phrase">Norman</em> appliance product reviewed in these pages last month (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2009/07/norman-network-protection-appliance
" target="_top">VB, July 2009, p.21</a>), making for a nice consistency across products. However, it seemed a little sluggish to respond at times, perhaps in part thanks to the general slowness observed in the browser rendering on which it relies. Navigation could not be simpler though, and with a fairly minimal set of controls little time was spent using the interface.</p><p>With no obvious option to set up scans of specific areas from within the GUI, context-menu scans were used for all on-demand tests. On a few occasions, returning to the GUI to check settings after a hefty scan found it whited-out and failing to respond, and in most cases a reboot was required to regain control, but protection seemed stable throughout. Rather amusingly, even while the main GUI is in this state, the licensing wizard &ndash; which has long been a regular feature during tests of <em class="phrase">Norman</em> offerings, popping up every so often to pester the user into fully licensing the product &ndash; is blocked by the UAC system and requires user confirmation to commence its nagging.</p><p>Scanning speeds were generally pretty good, and detection rates decent, with a notable dip in coverage in the most recent parts of the RAP sets.

The install is fairly quick, although there is a rather worrying pause at the end before the product finally appears. It has a pretty simple layout, and very little by way of configuration, which is always somewhat worrying to us. The on-access tests proceeded with ease, however, trundling through the speed tests in fairly sluggish time and showing quite some slowdown in the general responsiveness of the test system. Once we reached the infected sets, things got rather worse, with the on-access scan holding up for a few dozen samples before shutting itself down with a rather limp error message (perhaps overwhelmed by the cascade of alert messages it insisted on flooding down one side of the screen). This happened on numerous occasions, requiring at least one and occasionally several reboots to get the engine to reload and resume protection.</p><p>With much care though, we managed to get through the on-access tests with reasonable success, and the on-demand tests proved much smoother and more straightforward. On final analysis, detection levels were mediocre, with the RAP scores particularly low (but at least consistently so) across the weeks. The WildList was mostly handled well, but with a little under half of the samples of the new Virut variant missed, and a single false positive in the clean sets too, no VB100 award is forthcoming despite all our testing efforts.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/PCTools-AV-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.93%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.95%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>67.49%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.85%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>69.77%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>1</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3526456"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3526463"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3072782"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3222227"></a>PC Tools Internet Security 2009 6.0.1.441</h3></div></div></div><p>The second <em class="productname">PC Tools</em> offering is the company&rsquo;s complete suite, combining the anti-malware protection of the preceding product with additional anti-spyware and firewalling. The install is fairly similar, with a reminder to remove any competing products and the offer of a &lsquo;browser defender&rsquo; toolbar. The interface looks much the same but is even shorter on controls for the anti-malware component, perhaps in part thanks to the additional modules taking up valuable space. This time we opted to run the on-demand tests first and these proved much as expected, with some slight improvements over the plain AV product in some areas but, rather surprisingly, some areas less well covered. We had a few moments of worry when we found that the log was fixed at a maximum size, but alternative logging was shown to be available as part of the &lsquo;community&rsquo; program, designed to record data more accurately for the developers&rsquo; use.</p><p>Approaching the on-access scan with some caution, we soon found that although the process clearly states that it &lsquo;monitors and blocks&rsquo; the launching, accessing, copying or moving of malicious items, it actually appears to do none of these. Our standard on-access tool, which performs a simple open on the test files, provoked no response, and copying around the system seemed similarly ineffective. We eventually noted some pop-ups and logged items, and the occasional denial of read or write privileges, and in the end resorted to a combination of copying around the local system, and copying to the system across the network. The VB100 rules do not require blocking, only evidence that a malicious file has been noticed, so we were able to cobble results together from a combination of the product&rsquo;s internal logs, and by counting the files successfully written to, denied access to, disinfected etc. This was by no means simple, as pop-ups and log entries continued to appear &ndash; claiming to have intercepted and blocked something &ndash; up to three hours after the supposed blocking had taken place. The results gathered may thus be somewhat inaccurate, but only to the extent that the product was, and they tallied at least reasonably closely with those of the plain AV product, with again the missed Virut in the WildList and a single false positive being more than enough to deny the product a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/PCTools-IS-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.93%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.95%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>67.92%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>98.88%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>69.78%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>1</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3222231"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4438753"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2445921"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3902566"></a>PC Tools Spyware Doctor 6.0.1.441</h3></div></div></div><p>Testing <em class="phrase">PC Tools</em>&rsquo; mid-level product, a combination of the plain anti-virus with the company&rsquo;s longer-standing anti-spyware solution, was much the same fiddly, frustrating and occasionally frightening experience as testing the suite (from which it seems to differ only in the provision of a firewall). This time, a <em class="productname">Google</em> toolbar is offered during installation, for those who feel their browser does not have enough gadgets and gizmos. Otherwise, the interface, controls and layout are much the same.</p><p>Again, on-demand testing proved reasonably straightforward and reliable, and on-access scanning rather confusing and short of that all-important sense of security. Scores were once again gathered using multiple moving around of test sets and botched together from untrustworthy logs and analysis of file sets for changes, and should again be treated as unreliable thanks to the extreme difficulty of obtaining repeatable results. Extra care was taken with the WildList samples to ensure complete accuracy, and eventually we achieved a score directly matching the suite &ndash; fairly large numbers of the Virut strain not detected.

The installation is somewhat long-winded, offering removal of third-party software and the option of a firewall among its many stages. Once up and running, confirmation of a UAC pop-up is required before the main GUI can be accessed &ndash; and also, perhaps more surprisingly, before a context-menu scan is carried out. As ever, configuration is available in extreme depth for those seeking it, and options are generally easy to find and apply, and no issues with stability were encountered. We have previously mentioned issues with the progress bar as our main gripe about this product, but this time, in line with a general theme developing this month, we thought we should mention the rather awkward logging set-up. While it seems somewhat petty to complain about excessive detail, the product does produce a large, rather confusing log, with no option to record results of a particular scan to a particular location, and no option to purge existing data.

The install is simple, if a little slow, but once up and running things are fairly responsive and easy to use &ndash; the serious configuration areas eschew the slick and shiny stylings of the main interface in favour of more traditional, solid, serious greys and right angles.</p><p>Zipping through the speed tests proved something of a breeze, and on-access tests were also pretty speedy, but the on-demand scanner took some time, particularly over infected sets, taking several days to complete the biggest scan and causing some worries as the end of the test period approached fast. The poor test machine also grew increasingly hot as the scan proceeded. Logging is recorded in extreme depth, to such an extent that the log viewing utility within the product is barely usable for our purposes, taking hours at a time to convert all the information for display. Fortunately, the bare logs were easily parsed and showed some pretty superb detection levels in most areas, with only the proactive week of the RAP sets showing any decline from the heights of excellence &ndash; something which should be addressed by the various additional proactive technologies included with the product.</p><p>In the WildList however, a tiny number of the new Virut samples were not detected; further analysis from Symantec has shown that a minor adjustment to the detection routines for this item, in place only for a short time around the submission deadline, led to the possibility of a fraction of infected samples not being detected &ndash; as few as one in 100,000 by the developers&rsquo; reckoning. It is extremely unlucky, therefore, that our set of 2,500 contained two such samples, but our rules are clear and our sets are designed to test completeness of detection. After putting together a quite magnificent unbroken run of 44 VB100 passes stretching back to the last century, this month <em class="phrase">Symantec</em> is denied an award by a whisker.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/Symantec-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.998%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.9999%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>98.04%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.99%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4451255"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4451262"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3291671"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2309734"></a>Trustport Antivirus 2009 2.8.0.3016</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Trustport</em>&rsquo;s installation procedure manages to be swift and straightforward despite some unusual steps, which include some initial configuration for the duo of engines used to provide protection. After the required reboot a registration wizard is presented, and the various control facilities can be accessed from a menu placed in the system tray. The main configuration tool has both simple and advanced modes, which provide a reasonable level of configuration options with all the main areas covered.</p><p>The dual engine approach as usual resulted in some fairly lacklustre scanning speeds in both modes, and the added strain on our tired old test systems saw more of those unexpected shutdowns &ndash; quite frequently during lengthy scans of infected sets. With some careful management of strings of small scans and saving of logs, plenty of data was acquired however. On processing, the results showed the expected outstanding detection rates, taking pride of place at the top of the table for the reactive part of the RAP sets and a close second in the overall averages. With no problems encountered in the WildList or clean sets, <em class="phrase">Trustport</em> comfortably earns another VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/Trustport-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>97.52%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.22%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3216340"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2812557"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2812565"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3886440"></a>VirusBuster VirusBuster Professional 6.1.148</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">VirusBuster</em> takes its accustomed place at the end of the comparative roster, with its familiar product presenting the same old outlook to the world. Its install process is enlivened only by the customary UAC pop-up at the beginning, and runs slick and smooth to completion.</p><p>The rather quirky design no longer presents much difficulty, mainly thanks to experience, but some of its oddities can still take the unwary tester by surprise. Not least of these was the lack of an option to simply run a scan and log results; opting for the &lsquo;interactive&rsquo; method rather than the automatic cleaning/removal mode, we left a long scan of the clean set to run overnight, only to find, on arrival the next morning, that it had spent most of the night sitting waiting for a response to an alert. Fortunately, once this was given it provided an option to suppress further alerts, and could safely be left to run for another night. This set-up could be slightly frustrating for those who wish to leave their massive external hard drive to be scanned overnight but for whom the risk of false positives is too much of a concern to trust the product to automatically delete items detected.</p><p>Apart from this minor glitch everything else went smoothly, with some decidedly impressive results in the standard sets and some strong signs of improvement in the RAP sets too. The product had no problem handling the gamut of new Virut samples added to various sets either. The alert discovered after the abortive overnight scan presents the only hiccup in an otherwise excellent run &ndash; as with <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em> at the very beginning of this long journey, that single suspect file from <em class="phrase">Microsoft</em>&rsquo;s .NET package is wrongly described as a trojan, and a VB100 award is therefore denied this time around despite a very good performance.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/VirusBuster-Aug09.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>91.35%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.97%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>90.12%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>1</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3512420"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4154938"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4154945"></a></h3></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2348106"></a>Results tables</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/on-demand-detection-table.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/on-access-detection-table.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/archives.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/throughput-table.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/on-demand-throughput-graph.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/lag-table.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/file-access-lag-graph.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/RAP-table.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2009/08/RAP-August09.gif" /></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2906574"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div></div><p>A remarkable feeling of calm descends over the test lab as we reach the end of a long, tough month of testing. This has been a more than usually arduous comparative for many reasons, the most obvious of which being the sheer size of the field of submissions. Though not quite a record, it was still a lot of products to get through, actually larger than shown here thanks to a couple of additional products which were eventually excluded from the test but still took up precious testing time. One of these was excluded thanks to limitations on logging which, even with our usual willingness to make the effort and plod through our tests in smaller chunks, would simply have taken too long, and the other rendered the test machine completely unresponsive on reboot.</p><p>Many of the products in this test did prove stable, speedy and well behaved, but many others had issues far too serious to be classed as mere quirks and oddities. We experienced a large number of freezes, crashes and hangs, not just of the product interfaces or of specific scans but in many cases seeing the whole machine shutting down. At first we suspected this was simply some incompatibility between <em class="productname">Vista</em> and our standard test hardware, but as the test progressed it became clear that it was happening frequently with a small group of products and not at all with the rest, implying that the activities of those specific products were the main factor in the incidents. We continue to investigate some new test procedures which will focus on product stability and proper interaction with the operating system.</p><p>Another major issue this time has been logging difficulties, whether it be unreliable, unnecessarily truncated, bizarrely mangled or strangely formatted log files, encrypted log files only accessible via untrustworthy display systems, or downright peculiar layout and content. We are considering imposing some rules on logging requirements which must be satisfied by any product before it will be accepted into our tests as we feel that, while it may be a rare thing for the average home-user to encounter large logs with high numbers of detections listed, it is a simple requirement of any product that it be able to account for its behaviour and record its own history.</p><p>The bulk of this month&rsquo;s products made the VB100 grade &ndash; some just scraping across the line and some galloping home with plenty to spare. A handful of false positives caused problems for a few, most of which came from the sizeable new additions to the clean sets. There were also a few products that didn&rsquo;t quite cover the highly complex polymorphic file infector that found its way onto the WildList for this test. As always seems to be the case with these items, whenever they appear on the list there are a few casualties. This month has also seen another interesting batch of figures from our RAP testing, which will be added into the aggregate graphs displayed at <a href="/vb100/rap-index" target="_top">http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/rap-index.xml</a>.</p><p>With nothing more to be tested, the lab team is set to begin the process of clearing up and beginning preparations for the next test. We can only hope that some of the more troublesome vendors will be paying attention, and will provide better products next time, not just for our sakes, but for those of all their users.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2684276"></a>Technical details</h2></div></div></div><p><b>Test environment.&nbsp;</b>All products were tested on identical systems with <em class="productname">AMD Athlon64 X2</em> Dual Core 5200+ processors, 2GB RAM, dual 80GB and 400GB hard drives, running <em class="productname">Microsoft Windows Vista Business Edition</em>, Service Pack 2, 32 bit.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Any developers interested in submitting products for VB&#39;s comparative reviews should contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#553f3a3d3b7b3d3422302615233c27202637213b7b363a38" target="_top"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="91fbfef9ffbff9f0e6f4e2d1e7f8e3e4e2f3e5ffbff2fefc">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
