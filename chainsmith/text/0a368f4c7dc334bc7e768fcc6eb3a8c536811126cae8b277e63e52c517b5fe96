A currently ongoing malicious email campaign is impersonating ADP in an attempt to trick its customers into thinking that they’ve received a ‘Package Delivery Notification.’ In reality though, once a user clicks on any of the links found in the malicious email, they’re automatically exposed to the client-side exploits served by the Black Hole Exploit Kit.
