Labs Notes Monthly Recap  – Jan/2017

Every month we recap the latest posts on Sucuri Labs, written by our Malware Research Team (MRT) and Incident Response Teams (IRT).
The Sucuri Labs website provides technical analysis and industry updates directly from our teams on the front line. You can read past monthly recaps for an overview of the posts we’ve released each month.
Last month, one of the themes was obfuscation. This month, we see trends in how attackers spread and sustain their campaigns by undoing reactive security controls, deceiving webmasters, and using various tactics to hide their malicious campaigns.
