Removing Old Flash

Posted by Roger on 10 December 2006, 12:16 pm

When I ran the Secunia Software Inspector yesterday, it found I had old versions of Firefox, Winamp, Flash, and JAVA. The Flash and JAVA detections were complaining about older versions that were installed although I do have the current version installed. Secunia recommended that I remove the earlier version.
Its not really clear if having older versions of the Flash.ocx file on a computer is actually a vulnerability or not. I figured I’d try what they suggested anyway. I downloaded a flash remover tool from adobe. After closing any program that could be using Flash, I ran uninstall_flash_player.exe. I was still left with C:\windows\system32\Macromed\flash\Flash.ocx which has a file verison of 7.0.19.0. There was also a getflash.exe in that directory with the version number matching the latest version of Flash I had installed.
I’m not really sure if I should remove that file or not. I went ahead and installed the lasted version of Flash since I need to have flash on my computer.
