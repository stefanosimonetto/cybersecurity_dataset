Up2date 7.512 Released

Following the release of an Up2Date for our Version 8 line, we also have a release for Astaro Security Gateway Version 7 which is designed to address a connectivity issue with SwissCom DSL that was introduced due to changes by that ISP. We'll also take this chance to address some published vulnerabilites for SSL and fix a few bugs. Keep in mind that ASG V7 is due to sunset at the end of this year in December 2012 and will be end-of-life at that time.
