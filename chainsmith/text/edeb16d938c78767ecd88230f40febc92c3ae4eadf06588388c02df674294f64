Server Security: OSSEC Updated With GeoIP Support

We leverage OSSEC extensively to help monitor and protect our servers. If you are not familiar with OSSEC, it is an open source Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS); it has a powerful correlation and analysis engine that integrates log analysis, file integrity monitoring, centralized policy enforcement, rootkit detection, real-time alerting, and active response.
It provides a pretty complete coverage if you are looking for endpoint (server) monitoring.
If you have not used OSSEC before, I recommend reading my guide to get started:

Note that it requires root access to your servers and is meant for network and server administrators with Linux skills.
OSSEC With GeoIP
We recently made an improvement to OSSEC with the integration of the MaxMind GeoIP database (that maps an IP to a country and/or a city). This update was important to us, as it makes it a lot easier to monitor logs and understand what is going inside your network.

Here is a very quick example of how much easier things look:
Src IP: IP ADDRESS / USA / New Jersey
User: daniel
Dec 6 13:28:26 support sshd[22031]: Accepted publickey for daniel from ..
Compared to the original without GeoIP:
Src IP: IP ADDRESS
User: daniel
Dec 6 13:28:26 support sshd[22031]: Accepted publickey for daniel from ..
See the difference? It adds the country (and city) to the alerts, instead of just displaying the IP address. It also affects ossec-reported which now displays the geo information. This might feel rudimentary, but for anyone monitoring the logs this small change can make a lot of difference.
Installing GeoIP
Let’s get started with the installation process. You must first download the latest versions of OSSEC and GeoIP.
We’ll start with OSSEC:
# wget https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-c/releases/download/v1.6.7/GeoIP-1.6.7.tar.gz
# wget https://bitbucket.org/dcid/ossec-hids/get/tip.tar.gz

Then install GeoIP:
# tar -zxvf GeoIP-1.6.7.tar.gz
# cd GeoIP-1.6.7
# ./configure; make; make install

Once the installation is completed, you should see GeoIP installed inside /usr/local/lib:
# ls -la /usr/local/lib/libGeoIP.so
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 17 Dec 6 13:17 /usr/local/lib/libGeoIP.so -> libGeoIP.so.1.6.7

If you do not have /usr/local/lib inside your library loading path, you can add it by modifying /etc/ld.so.conf:
# echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
# ldconfig

Or just set LD_PRELOAD before starting OSSEC:
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Once completed, you need to download the latest GeoLiteCity database directly from MaxMind and copy it to /usr/share/GeoIP:
# wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
# gunzip -d GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
# mkdir /usr/share/GeoIP/
# mv GeoLiteCity.dat /usr/share/GeoIP/

Install OSSEC
Once GeoIP is installed, you are ready to install OSSEC. You can follow the instructions from the step-by-step link above or just run these 3 commands that will guide you into the right direction:
$ wget https://bitbucket.org/dcid/ossec-hids/get/tip.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf tip.tar.gz
$ cd dcid-ossec-hids-*
$ ./install.sh

Installing OSSEC is fairly straight forward and will give you a lot of value out of the box, with minimal changes. If you have used OSSEC before, you will now see the Country/City in addition to the IP address in every alert log.
Example:
** Alert 1449426506.153: mail – syslog,fts,authentication_success
2015 Dec 06 13:28:26 support->/var/log/secure
Rule: 10100 (level 4) -> ‘First time user logged in.’
Src IP: [IPADDRESS] / USA / New Jersey
User: daniel
Dec 6 13:28:26 support sshd[22031]: Accepted publickey for daniel from [IPADDRESS] port 44848 ssh2
Note GeoIP support is only available in the repository I provided in this post. If you are using OSSEC already, try it out.
If you are responsible for managing a dedicated server (or VPS), I also recommend adding it to your arsenal to know what is going on with your servers. An early warning system in case of a compromise can make a difference between a successful or a failed response.
