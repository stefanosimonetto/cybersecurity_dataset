File this in the small yet helpful utility bin.  You can use YouTube-dl to download videos from YouTube.  I don't have Flash installed on FreeBSD, but I do have Mplayer.  This means I can use YouTube-dl as follows:orr:/home/richard$ python youtube-dl usage: youtube-dl [options] video_urloptions:  -h, --help            print this help text and exit  -v, --version         print program version and exit  -u USERNAME, --username=USERNAME                        account username  -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD                        account password  -o FILE, --output=FILE                        output video file name  -q, --quiet           activates quiet mode  -s, --simulate        do not download videoorr:/home/richard$ python youtube-dl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPXF-iZh488Retrieving video webpage... done.Extracting video URL parameters... done.Video data found at http://youtube-082.vo.llnwd.net/d1/01/F3/bPXF-iZh488.flvRetrieving video data... 6608k of 6608k done.Video data saved to bPXF-iZh488.flvorr:/home/richard$ mplayer bPXF-iZh488.flv MPlayer 1.0pre7try2-3.4.4 (C) 2000-2005 MPlayer Team...edited...Starting playback......truncated...Obviously as an added benefit I can keep a local archive of my favorite videos.I learned about this program through Freshmeat.net, but I just saw a FreeBSD port was added today.
