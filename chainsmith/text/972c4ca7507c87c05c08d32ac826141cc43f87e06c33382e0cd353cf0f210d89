Network up2date

Today we have released ASG Up2Date 8.002. The main purpose of this release is to address the majority of the outstanding  bugs which have been reported since 8.001, increasing the stability of  your ASG V8 installation. For those still using Version 7, the 8.002 Up2Date will also act as the destination "landing" version for the upcoming  one-touch V7–>V8 Hardware Appliance Upgrade which will be available as part of the ASG 7.508 Up2Date release in October. We will have more information on the appliance upgrade process for you at that time. Read on for the full details of this Up2Date.

The 8.002 release also adds a feature for having SMTP Footers which are  configurable per-profile, allows for ASG to communicate with two Astaro  Command Center installations simultaneously, and adds some new options and tweaks for Web Application Security (reverse proxy). The ACC feature is  something many partners have asked for, since each ACC server can have  different management permissions. In this way, partners can retain full management control of installations for their customers, while still letting the customer see and  interact with their sites in a lesser way with reduced permissions (or  vice-versa) using a second Astaro Command Center.
Lastly, for those anxiously awaiting the 8.100 Beta which will introduce V8-support for our newly released Wireless Access Points, this is currently planned to start near the end of October. Stay  tuned for more information!
