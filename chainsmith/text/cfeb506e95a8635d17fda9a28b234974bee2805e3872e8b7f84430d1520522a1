Financial institutions and online payment processors are a common target for cybercriminals, who systematically brand-jack and abuse the reputation of their trusted brands, in an attempt to scam or serve malware to their customers.
Over the past 24 hours, cybercriminals have launched yet another spam campaign, impersonating PayPal, in an attempt to trick its users into thinking that they’ve received a “Transaction Confirmation“, which in reality they never really made. Once users click on any of the links found in the malicious emails, they’re exposed to the client-side exploits served by the Black Hole Exploit Kit.

duriginal.net – 222.238.109.66 – Email: blackchromedesign2@ymail.com
Name server: NS1.HTTP-PAGE.NET – 31.170.106.17 – Email: ezvalue@yahoo.com
Name server: NS2.HTTP-PAGE.NET – 7.129.51.158 – Email: ezvalue@yahoo.com
The campaign shares the same infrastructure as the following previous profiled malicious campaigns:

Fake ‘ADP Speedy Notifications’ lead to client-side exploits and malware

Fake LinkedIn ‘Invitation Notifications’ themed emails lead to client-side exploits and malware

indicating that the three of these campaigns have been launched by the same malicious party.
Upon successsful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 423daf9994d552ca43f8958634ede6ee – detected by 23 out of 46 antivirus scanners as Trojan-Spy.Win32.Zbot.ilmw.
Once executed, the sample creates the following processess on the affected hosts:
C:Documents and Settings<USER>Application DataCesazuyv.exe
C:WINDOWSsystem32cmd.exe” /c “C:DOCUME~1<USER>~1LOCALS~1Temptmp14241653.bat
As well as the following Mutexes:
