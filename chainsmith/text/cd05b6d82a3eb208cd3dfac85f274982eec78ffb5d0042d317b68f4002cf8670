LizaMoon Mass SQL injection (ur.php) – Updates

There has been a lot of talk for the last few days about a mass sql injection targeting IIS/ASP.net sites.
Those attacks has been going for a while and the lizamoon.com/ur.php is not the only domain being used to distribute the malware, making the attack a lot bigger than what has been reported.
For example, the alisa-carter.com/ur.php caused more than 900 domains to get blacklisted and google reports more than 500k URLs infected with it.
These are just some of the other domains being used. If you search for each one on Google you will find thousands of references (all injected on IIS sites, using the same ur.php scheme and hosted on similar locations):
