Hilary Kneber at it again: voip.dialistico.net

The Hilary Kneber group is at it again. We are now tracking their usage of voip.dialistico.net to push malware to quite a few sites. If you don’t know about them, just take a look at our blog history. Most of the mass attacks we posted were controlled and created by them.
All the infected sites have this malware:

<script src="http://voip.dialistico.net/products/voip.php”..

Which is generated by a large string of encoded PHP added to all files in a site. If your site got hacked, we have a clean up solution here: https://blog.sucuri.net/2010/05/simple-cleanup-solution-for-latest.html. Some details here too: MW:GDD:3.
The above code loads malware from www4.pc-guard-soft6.net, which is hosted at 69.57.173.221 (from unique-protection.com – famous fake AV site).
