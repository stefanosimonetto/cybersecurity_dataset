Network up2date

This new ISO and Up2Date changes the GUI to the new look&feel to the ASG V7 style and it adds V7 support.  ACC 1.4 also handles the new daylight saving time dates from the Energy Savings Act in the US and Canada.

V7 support in ACC 1.4 means:

Cluster Monitoring
Global Pattern Version
UPS Battery Charge Monitoring
Up2Date Cache for all V7 packages

Besides these new features there are some minor bug fixes included in the new release.  The Astaro Up2Date technology makes it easy to upgrade your installed Astaro Command Center to the latest version: Start the Up2Date under "ACC Management >> Maintenance".  All Up2Dates are GNUPG-signed!
Virtual Appliance
ACC V1.4 is also made available as a VMWare virtual appliance. Similar to the ASG virtual appliance, ACC can be easily deployed within VMWare virtualized environments, such as VMWare Server, VMWare ESX Server, VMWare Workstation or VMWare Player, by using a pre-configured/pre-installed ACC ISO.
