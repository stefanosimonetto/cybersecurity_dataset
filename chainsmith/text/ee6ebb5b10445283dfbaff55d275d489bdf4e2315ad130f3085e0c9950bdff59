Cryptocurrency mining has been used by cybercriminals to make a quick and easy profit while corrupting the victim’s machine in the process.

In the last months, we stumbled upon some JavaScript files apparently used to mine cryptocurrencies directly within the browser. For a long time now, cybercriminals have taken advantage of cryptocurrency mining in order to make a profit. However, they generally use malware or potentially unwanted applications they install on the victim’s machine in order to turn a dishonest penny.

In this particular case, the mining is performed directly within the browser when the user browses to certain websites. Thus, there is no need to infect the victim’s machine or to exploit vulnerabilities. All that is needed is a browser with JavaScript activated, which is the default state of most browsers. This blogpost describes the research we performed in order to better understand this threat.

We started digging into our telemetry and found that the threat was partially distributed using malvertising. This kind of CPU-intensive task is generally prohibited by the majority of ad networks because it substantially degrades the user experience. It might seem counterintuitive to mine cryptocurrencies in the browser – we know that mining bitcoins requires a lot of CPU power – but the cybercriminals, as we will see later on, chose to mine cryptocurrencies that do not require custom hardware to mine effectively. Also, it is easier to reach a significant number of machines by “infecting” websites than it is by infecting user machines.

Even though this kind of unwanted behavior can be used in any country, we noticed that this particular campaign was mostly impacting Russia and Ukraine.

Figure 1 shows the five main countries affected by this threat. It is important to note that this targeting is probably due to the language of the websites in which the scripts are injected, as we were able to access them from a US IP address.

Figure 2 shows the historical Cisco Umbrella Top 1M rank of one of the domains –reasedoper[.]pw – hosting these scripts. We notice a significant increase in DNS lookups for the domain over the March-April 2017 period. On June 28th 2017 reasedoper[.]pw was ranked 26,300th. This is almost the same rank as GitHub’s quite popular text-sharing website GitHub Gist (gist.github.com), which was ranked 26,293rd on the same date.

History

The idea of cryptocurrency mining in browsers is not something new. In 2013, a group of MIT students founded a company called Tidbit, which offered a web service to mine Bitcoins. Instead of displaying advertisements, webmasters could include Tidbit’s scripts in their websites to earn money via Bitcoin mining. However, the service founders were served a subpoena by the New Jersey Attorney General’s office because they used the users’ computing power without their agreement. They finally reached a settlement, but had to abandon their project.

Previously, several other services, such as bitp[.]it, provided web browser Bitcoin mining. Due to increasing inefficiency of mining Bitcoins using a regular CPU or GPU, these services have shut down. For example, the bitp[.]it project closed in July, 2011.

How it is distributed

The distribution method of this kind of script is a key point for determining if it is legitimate or unwanted. In this particular case, we were able to find two distinct ways users can be forced to execute these scripts: malvertising and a hardcoded snippet of JavaScript code. Figure 3 shows the global distribution scheme of the mining scripts.

Malvertising

The main distribution method of the mining scripts is malvertising. Generally, it consists of buying traffic from an ad network and distributing malicious JavaScript instead of a traditional advertisement. In this particular case, we are not sure if the injection of the script was intended or if listat[.]biz was compromised. However, listat[.]biz is really suspicious as it seems to mimic LiveInternet counter (LI stat), which is a legitimate web counter. Moreover, many suspicious domains have been registered with the same email address, including lmodr[.]biz, which is also present in the malvertising chain.

The main websites that provided traffic to the mining scripts during July 2017 are shown in Figure 4. We notice that most are video streaming or in-browser gaming websites. This makes sense, since their users tend to spend more time on the same webpage while they watch a movie or play a game. Additionally, such webpages would be expected to have a higher than normal CPU load, which would tend to mask the additional load from the mining script. Thus, it allows the mining scripts to run longer and use more computing power.

The site we observed with most malicious ad impressions, okino[.]tv, seems to be particularly popular. At the time of writing, it had an Alexa Rank of 907 in Russia and 233 in Ukraine. Some of the other websites also seem to be popular, being in the Alexa Top 1000 for Russia.

The first three hops just inject the script provided by the next hop, as shown in Figures 8, 9 and 10. The first domain used in the redirection (skyadsvideo1[.]ru in our example) is not always the same. We also have seen code.moviead55[.]ru. Both have resolved to the same IP addresses, 167.114.238.246 and 167.114.249.120.  According to Whois data for the domain skyad[.]video, whose subdomain code.skyad[.]video also resolved to the same two IP adresses, the domains seem to be related to the SkyAdVideo ad network owner.
