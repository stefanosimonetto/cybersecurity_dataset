Flash vulnerability

Just when you thought you were done patching for the year, Adobe releases a security bulletin for Flash.
Adobe Flash Player 9.0.48.0 and earlier, 8.0.35.0 and earlier, and 7.0.70.0 and earlier need to be patched.
Dont forget this needs to be verified for each browser youâ€™re running.
