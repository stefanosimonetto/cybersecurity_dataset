Detection rate for the malicious attachment: MD5: fe02ffade8660c89633862888ec3b1a8 detected by 3 out of 43 antivirus vendors as ZIP/Bredolab.A!Camelot; Mal/BredoZp-B.
What’s particularly interesting about this campaign is that, it demonstrates the lack of QA (Quality Assurance) applied by the cybrecriminals who launched it. Case in point – the attached archive in all emails has been corrupted, preventing potential victims from becoming infected.
