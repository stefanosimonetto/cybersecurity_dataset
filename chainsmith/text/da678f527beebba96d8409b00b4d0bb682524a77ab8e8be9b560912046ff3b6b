A week in security (December 04 – December 10)
Last week on the blog, we looked at a RIG EK malware campaign, explored how children are being tangled up in money mule antics, took a walk through the world of Blockchain, and gave a rundown of what’s involved when securing web applications. We also laid out the trials and tribulations of the Internet of Things, advised you to be on the lookout for an urgent TeamViewer update, tore down the disguise of new Mac malware HiddenLotus, sighed at the inevitability of a Napoleon-themed piece of ransomware, and unveiled our New Mafia report.
