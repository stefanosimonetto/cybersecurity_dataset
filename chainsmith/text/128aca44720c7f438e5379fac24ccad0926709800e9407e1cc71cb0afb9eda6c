“A Man Jumped on the Mall” Facebook Scam
We have a fake Facebook video located at
foxnews-tv(dot)info/index(dot)php
which claims to show…(takes a deep breath):
A man jumped on the mall after he saw the real face of his online girlfriend without camera 360 or retrica (sic) filters

To view this non-existent video, you have to share it on Facebook and are then redirected to various places depending on your region. Here’s one:
Video download software is required to download videos

Should you download and install the executable, you’ll end up with an iLivid download manager which Malwarebytes Anti-Malware detect as PUP.Optional.Bandoo (VirusTotal 11 / 54)
Fake Facebook videos are one of the oldest tricks in the book. The non-Facebook URL, the image file masquerading as a comments section, the typically salacious video content – these are all indicators of a probable scam.
It will probably be a long time before we see the back of this particular fakeout, but that doesn’t mean we have to make it easy for them. Feel free to let friends and relatives know if they’re sharing fake videos without realising it, and let’s see if we can keep the phony video noise ratio down to a minimum.
