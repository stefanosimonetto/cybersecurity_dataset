Popular Game Rental Site Issues Statement on Alleged “Fraudulent Payment Attempts”
It’s come to light that Boomerangrentals(dot)co(dot)uk [traffic stats],  is investigating claims from customers that they’ve had fraudulent payment attempts on cards registered to them.
Up to now, Boomerang had made the following comments on the unfolding situation on Reddit: [1], [2].
The Boomerang website has since been taken offline (“Our website is currently down for maintenance work, please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused”), and they just issued a statement in relation to events of the last day or two. It reads as follows:
Following an initial enquiry at the end of last week, we have had a number of
customers raise concerns regarding fraudulent payment attempts on their card
details that are also registered with us.

We are fully investigating this issue and have temporarily removed access to
our website while this continues. We have contacted our Payment
Provider Sagepay and our Merchant Bank World Pay and neither have any reported concerns relating to us.
However, please be assured we are treating this with the utmost urgency and
can provide more information on our findings as they become available.

If you have any concerns, please contact your card issuer.
We apologise for any inconvenience the removal of our site has caused and
thank you for your patience as we continue to investigate further.
There’s no additional information available at time of writing, but we’ll continue to update the post should anything new come to light.
If you think you might be affected by what’s being discussed up above, you should indeed contact your card issuer as a first step and monitor any attempts at payment made.
