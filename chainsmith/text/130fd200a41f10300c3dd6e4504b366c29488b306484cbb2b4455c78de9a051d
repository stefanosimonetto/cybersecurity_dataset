Cybercriminals continue adapting to the exponential penetration of mobile devices through the systematic release of DIY (do-it-yourself) mobile number harvesting tools, successfully setting up the foundations for commercial managed/on demand mobile phone number harvesting services, ultimately leading to an influx of mobile  malware/spam campaigns. In addition to boutique based DIY operations, sophisticated, ‘innovation’ and market development-oriented cybercriminals are actively working on the development of commercially available Android-based botnet generating tools, further fueling growth into the market segment.
In a series of blog posts, we’ve been profiling multiple cybercrime-friendly services/malicious Android-based underground market releases, further highlighting the professionalization of the market segment in terms of sophistication and QA (Quality Assurance).
We’ve recently spotted a service offering 5M+ harvested and segmented Russian mobile phone numbers on a per business status/gender/driving license basis. What’s particularly interesting about this service is the fact that it exposes a long-run fraudulent Win32:SMSSend serving infrastructure (SEVAHOST-AS Seva-Host Ltd (AS49313), segmented harvested mobile phone numbers of Sochi citizens, a fake (paid) medical leave/absence service targeting Sochi citizens, and a portfolio of rogue mobile apps leading to the exposure of a mobile botnet, surprisingly relying on an identical hardware/bot ID.

The existence of the secondary services (segmented mobile phone numbers belonging to Sochi citizens/paid medical leave services), parked on the same IP as the original 5M+ harvested mobile phone numbers offering service, is a decent example of market segmentation in the context of an event-based type of underground market offering targeting the Sochi Olympics. Not surprisingly, cybercriminals have already taken advantage of this segment, and in a true fraudulent/malicious nature, have launched social engineering driven Android-based malware serving SMS spam campaigns (MD5: 361e92c344294d8b4fce0c302f61716a).
