“To get free Steam games, follow these 4 steps…”
Here’s a .tk URL claiming to offer up free Steam games located at
free-steam-games-2014(dot)tk

If you’re fond of seeing [Sic] pop up in a piece of writing then here comes Christmas (and possibly Halloween):
Choose A Game That You Want To Grab It [Sic] For Free.
Put Your Steam Account Information Bellow. [Sic]
Click On "Get Your Game" Button.
Finally Wait For 12-13 Hours
And You Will Reserver [Sic] Your Game.

TO CHOOSE YOUR GAME PLEASE CLICK HER [Sic]
Oh boy.
Next up is a large collection of “Select your game” images to choose from, even though every single game image leads to the same URL.

The final step is the following screen which asks for 1) Steam Username 2) Steam password 3) Email address 4) Email password:

Even if they were able to give away a bunch of free games, it makes zero sense for them to be asking for your email login too.
Being asked to wait x amount of hours is also a huge red flag, as this is typically done to keep you away from the stolen account while the scammers set about changing your login and / or plundering your account.
As amateur hour as this particular example is, there are still people out there who will do anything for a freebie. Never give up your logins to random websites, and take the time to enable Steam Guard on your account if you haven’t done so already. A quick and easy “free gift” could prove to be very costly…
