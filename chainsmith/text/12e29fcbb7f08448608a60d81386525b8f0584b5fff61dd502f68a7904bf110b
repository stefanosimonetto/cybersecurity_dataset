I came across Ipsumdump today.  It's a program to read traffic and summarize what it sees in a user-defined format on one line.  In the example below I watch the sf1 interface in real time and tell Ipsumdump to show a timestamp, source IP and port, and destination IP and port.  Ipsumdump works against multiple interfaces simultaneously as well as pcap files and NetFlow traces.  In the example below the first two packets are an ICMP echo and echo reply, followed by the beginning of an SSH session.
