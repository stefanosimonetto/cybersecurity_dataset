Previously I documented installing VMware Workstation 6 Beta on my Thinkpad x60s.  I decided to uninstall Workstation and install VMware Server 1.0.2.  I should have used the vmware-uninstall.pl script but even without using it directly I managed to remove the old Workstation installation without real trouble.Running Server on Ubuntu 6.10 (desktop) required me to add a few packages.  I found Martti Kuparinen's installation guide very helpful.  I had to add the following packages to ensure a smooth Server installation.sudo apt-get install xinetdsudo apt-get install libX11-devsudo apt-get install xlibs-devI did not have to install linux-kernel-headers.I was really impressed that Martti provided a patch for two scripts that did not work correctly out of the box.  When I applied the patch I was able to start VMware's Web server and access it via my browser.richard@neely:/tmp$ wget http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/httpd.vmware.diff--13:52:24--  http://users.piuha.net/martti/comp/ubuntu/httpd.vmware.diff           => `httpd.vmware.diff'Resolving users.piuha.net... 193.234.218.130Connecting to users.piuha.net|193.234.218.130|:80... connected.HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OKLength: 2,973 (2.9K) [text/plain]100%[====================================>] 2,973         --.--K/s             13:52:25 (1.81 MB/s) - `httpd.vmware.diff' saved [2973/2973]richard@neely:/tmp$ cd /richard@neely:/$ sudo patch -b -p0 < /tmp/httpd.vmware.diff Password:patching file /etc/init.d/httpd.vmwarepatching file /usr/lib/vmware-mui/src/lib/httpd.vmwarerichard@neely:/$ sudo netstat -natup | grep vmtcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8333            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     5205/httpd.vmware   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8222            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     5205/httpd.vmware  Thanks to this guide I made this addition to /etc/xinetd.d/vmware-authd so the vmware console on port 902 TCP didn't listen on all interfaces:    bind            = 127.0.0.1To prevent the Web server from starting at boot and potentially listening on a hostile network, I removed the x bit from the script in /etc/init.d so it would not be started at boot.  I can start it manually.richard@neely:~$ sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/httpd.vmwarerichard@neely:~$ sudo sh /etc/init.d/httpd.vmware start   Starting httpd.vmware:                                              doneI noticed while installing the packages the suggestion to run apt-get autoremove, so I did once everything was installed.richard@neely:~$ sudo apt-get autoremovePassword:Reading package lists...
