Network Partners Products & Services Server Support Bash Shellshock Vulnerabilities

In the light of the recent Bash vulnerability known as “Shellshock” (CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169), here’s the reality instead of the hype.
Shellshock is a newly-discovered vulnerability in Bash (the Bourne Again Shell), one of the most commonly used shells on Linux, UNIX and OS X.
Although it can be exploited in some cases, the good news is that not all implementations can be exploited, and only certain services and applications allow a hacker to exploit this issue.

See our articles and other resources on Naked Security and at sophos.com/shellshock for an explanation of the vulnerability itself.
In addition, we have examined our products and we are confident that the Shellshock vulnerability can’t be exploited in any Sophos product.
As far as we’re aware, we don’t have any servers or services that could have been exploited due to his bug. This includes our internal business systems, Sophos web servers, update servers, partner portal and support forums.
