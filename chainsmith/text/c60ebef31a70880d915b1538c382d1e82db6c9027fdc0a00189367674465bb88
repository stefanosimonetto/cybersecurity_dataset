More on mc21.tmp and mc22.tmp

Posted by Roger on 23 September 2005, 7:52 pm

A lot of people are coming to this site looking for help for Symantec Antivirus Backdoor.Graybird detections on mc21.tmp or mc22.tmp. My post on my experience last Friday has been picked up by Google. Unfortunately they are linking to my main page instead of the article itself and that post is about to fall off the front page. (To be fair, blogsearch.google.com does have the correct link).
I have continued to see a few new detections of this at work. I need to check if those systems are up-to-date on their virus definitions. If they do have defs where this false positive is supposedly fixed, then there is still an issue.
By popular demand, I’m posting the email Symantec sent out last week. It is my belief that this information is considered public and not under any NDA. In other words Symantec please do not sue.
