Got to check those typos

I’m searching the Microsoft knowledgebase for help in letting a ISA 2004 server get to Windows Update when I find a kb article on the subject. It has links that should be put in an “allow” destination set. One of the links is http://ntservicepack.micrososft.com. A quick who is query shows that the domain is not owned by Microsoft. I checked the site over in a text browser and it seems to just be loading ads, but I’m not 100% sure.
I’ve notified Microsoft using the link on the page for article errors.
