Wargames - You’ve seen the movie, maybe you experienced it, but that was 20 years 
ago, certainly things have improved since then, haven’t they?
[Word Count: 24]

As we enter the new security paradigm many fear we are faced with resourceful threats 
and exposures.  While this is certainly true, companies need to address some age-old 
exposures in addition to looking into the future.  Currently, many companies are 
concerned with Internet connectivity, spending large sums of money securing these 
connections to the world.  As more and more companies secure this avenue, hackers 
begin to look for other ways to break-in.  Often this other way is the same old way they 
used before, just with a few new twists. This makes securing your remote access1 crucial.
[Word Count: 97]

“Wargames” - You’ve seen the movie, maybe you experienced it, but that was 20 years 
ago, certainly things have improved since then, haven’t they?  Don’t be too sure.  Now 
more than ever companies need to understand all of their threats and vulnerabilities, 
coupled with their high value business objectives.  Addressing dial-in risks, as part of any 
total security architecture makes good business sense.
[Word Count: 63]

This stuff doesn’t happen in real life, does it?  The movie was based on a true story, as 
was Clifford Stoll’s now famous hacker book “The Cuckoo’s Egg”.  More importantly 
these techniques are still being mimicked today.
[Word Count: 37]

Just how do hackers break into a network through a phone line?  It is a fairly simple 
technique known as war dialing (gaining the very name from the movie itself).  The 
following case study was based on an actual company, a Healthcare provider, although 
the results are representative of findings across several industries.  The case study will 
demonstrate the ease and effectiveness of using a war dialer to break into a corporate 
network.

having the same area code.  Once we have obtained ABC’s exchange and range we next 
determine the phone numbers that have devices2 connected to them.  Certain fax 
machines may carry the same characteristics as a modem; the war dialer can filter out 
these devices.  A war dialer3 in simple terms will take the input range or exchange, which 
we have already obtained, in this instance 216.555-0,9999, 216.556-0,2000, and 216.557-
1234-1244, and dial each number attempting to connect to any devices that answer.
[Word Count: 82]

The hardware needed to run a war dial is surprisingly minimal.  Any PC running DOS 6.2 
and a modem card, or external modem will suffice.  Boot your machine, and configure 
the modem to live on COM2 and THC will do the rest.  Configuring THC is also 
relatively straightforward, for the example above the following command will initiate and 
run the war dialer:
[Word Count: 62]

C:\THC\thc-scan /m:216-555-xxxx /r:0000-9999 /c /q
[Word Count: 5]

Once the war dialer has been configured and started as shown above, it will randomly 
dial each number looking for devices or carriers.  When the war dialer connects to a 
device it immediately captures the information displayed and stores the banner in a text 
                                                        
2 A device in this instance will be anything that answers with a modem connection for example a Cisco 
Router, Windows NT RAS or Windows 95 with PC-Anywhere running. 
3 A War-Dialer is a program that systematically dials a predefined list of phone numbers and categorizes 
the results as being Busy, Carrier, No Carrier, or Timeout.

file for later viewing.  The war dialer would classify this connect as a carrier.  The war 
dialer will place each number into one of four categories as described below:
[Word Count: 29]

• Busy’s are numbers that, during dialing, were in use; these numbers are placed into a
[Word Count: 16]

pool of numbers to be redialed.  Periodically during testing the dialer will pull busy 
numbers from the busy pool and redial them.  This process will be continued until the 
number is categorized as a Carrier, a No Carrier or a Timeout.  After 8 attempts with 
the number being continuously busy, the number is marked as busy, and no further 
automated attempts are made. 
• Carriers are numbers that had a device on the remote side to auto-answer and
[Word Count: 78]

attempt to negotiate a data session, i.e. PC-Anywhere, Windows NT Remote Access 
Service (RAS).  Note: any device that responds with a carrier, is a concern to the 
organization as they may provide a “gateway” into the internal network. 
• No Carriers are numbers that answered, but did not attempt to negotiate a data
[Word Count: 53]

session, these are typically voice response, or other non-machine oriented pickups, 
including any automated attendant-type phone numbers. 
• Timeouts are numbers that were dialed with no response of any type.
[Word Count: 30]

Hackers are only interested in carriers found, or devices that answered with a data 
session.  As noted earlier war dialers can determine fax machines from a true data 
connection.  Once the war dialer is finished, the next step would be to view the banners 
that were captured.  Below are examples that were captured during the case study:

Did the war dialer break in?  No.  The war dialer is only a tool in this overall process.  
There still needs to be some level of expertise involved to understand and analyze the war 
dialer results.
[Word Count: 36]

The first example is a banner captured from a machine running PC-Anywhere.  Although 
not easily recognized by the naked eye, this banner is distinguishable by the:
[Word Count: 26]

Why is the banner so important?  Without knowing the system you have connected to, it 
may be impossible to properly connect to that system.  In this example the host is running 
PC-Anywhere software, thus in order to establish a proper connection the hacker must 
use the PC-Anywhere client.  In this instance the host machine is not requesting any form 
of authentication.  Once a hacker connects he has free access to the machine and possibly 
the entire network.  For our case study, we were able to connect to five (5) machines
[Word Count: 90]

running 
PC-Anywhere. 
 
These 
machines were all logged in as 
Administrator and we were able to 
map the internal network to identify 
additional targets.  Further, we were 
able (using the file transfer feature of 
PC-Anywhere) to download and crack 
the SAM4 files and eventually take over 
the entire internal network.  No one from the network security staff knew that we were 
connected and there were no logs of our activity.  The security ramifications of this 
breach can be quite far reaching.  Unrestricted access to the connected machines, and 
ABC’s entire internal network can obviously have serious consequences.
[Word Count: 96]

The second banner displays a Shiva remote access server, a very common centralized 
device used to authenticate users onto the network.  This device can be recognized by the 
banner:
[Word Count: 29]

As demonstrated above the war dialer will attempt some very basic commands to try to 
gain access to the device or generate more information that may be used to identify the 
device in later steps.
[Word Count: 35]

That’s it, are we done?  As demonstrated from the above example, running a war dialer is 
fairly simple, however understanding and analyzing the results takes some more detailed 
knowledge and understanding of remote access services.  The war dialer can identify 
possible devices that may be used to gain entry into a company, but it is up to the

perseverance and the expertise of the hacker to gain entry.  The next step is to review the 
carrier logs and determine, using the method described above, what the device is.
[Word Count: 30]

Is there anything that can help me identify these devices?  There is always an easier way.  
PhoneSweep has the potential to identify over 250 devices automatically while running 
the war dialer.  It uses the same techniques described above matching known banner 
signatures to ones that have been preprogrammed.  For our example we used a reference 
from a well know hacking magazine called Phrack (Volume Six, Issue Forty-Seven, File 
6 of 22).
[Word Count: 71]

From our example we were able to connect to ABC’s network without authorization to 
over seven (7) different devices and from that we had the potential to 
download/modify/delete patient identifiable information.
[Word Count: 31]

How can war dialing be prevented?  While it is extremely difficult to stop war dialing, it 
is possible to make the practice less fruitful.  When planning to secure remote access 
there are a several points that should be addressed:
[Word Count: 39]

Using the method described above war dial your particular organization.  
Keep in mind that war dialing is not 100%.  It does not guarantee that you 
have found all of your dial-in lines.  Depending on when you run the war 
dialer, some lines may be inactive (often users will only enable their desktop 
dial devices when they leave for the day) or in use (this is why the war dial 
software will attempt a connection 8 times before giving up). 
Regularly monitor existing log features of your dial-in architecture
[Word Count: 88]

Monitor for failed logon attempts and successful logons during unusual 
business hours.  Most centralized dial facilities have a method for logging 
activity.  Unfortunately, the logs are often not reviewed, or not configured to 
capture essential information, such as failed attempts.  If your dial-in 
equipment provides the capability you should keep any caller-id logs as well 
as the caller’s user name, connect time, and connect duration.  This can then 
be reviewed with users should the need arise.

Consolidate all dial-in connectivity to a centralized device
[Word Count: 8]

By consolidating dial-in connectivity into one area, it will allow connections 
to be monitored as recommended above.  By centrally administering dial-in 
lines you will be placing control of vital resources in network administrators 
hands.  These administrators typically have a greater concern for security than 
an average user installing PC-Anywhere on their desktop.  Additionally, 
overall administration time will be reduced (although this benefit will be 
difficult to quantify). 
Distribute analog lines throughout various exchanges
[Word Count: 73]

Although a simple example of security by obscurity, if someone has selected 
your company as a target, they will likely use common numbers from business 
cards, web home pages and the like.  By placing your dial-in pool on a 
separate exchange, it may help to prevent an attack from a war dialer.  As with 
all aspects of security, each small action raises the bar a little bit.  Making the 
successful attack less likely. 
Disable any banners that do not need to be present
[Word Count: 83]

As noted above the easiest way to identify a carrier is by the banner that is 
displayed.  Certain prompts cannot be modified, however all references to 
your organization should be removed.  At times a hacker is simply sweeping 
numbers looking for something interesting.  If you have your company’s name 
appear on a banner it may increase the likelihood of further attacks. 
Require two-factor one-time authentication
[Word Count: 65]

Develop remote access policies and procedures to address a variety of security 
and procedural issues. 
Continuous assessments
[Word Count: 17]

Did someone call an auditor?  Although war dialing is not a solution to remote 
access security, it can determine if policies are being followed or if rogue 
modems are being used.
[Word Count: 31]

Any remote access solution must be reliable, easy-to-use and secure.  Does remote dial-in 
connectivity have a place in today’s fast paced Internet driven economy?  The answer is 
an emphatic yes.  There is no need to throw away your old dial-in solution for newer 
technologies.  Solutions exist to allow users requiring PC-Anywhere access the ability to 
use the centrally controlled and monitored dial-in pool.  The increasing mobility of
