Rail Europe trying to sell me Amoxicillin â€“ Pharma hack

I was looking to buy some Amoxicillin online today and didnâ€™t want to get a prescription. So I went to Google and searched for it. Interesting enough, Rail Europe ( http://blog.raileurope.com ) was the first result.
Ok, so Iâ€™m kidding, I was not searching for Amoxicillin. I was however being truthful about Rail Europe being hacked with the infamous Blackhat SEO Spam (pharma) technique.
Infecting sites with ads for medicine to treat infections, how awesome is that?
