The WebFilter and the Wikileak

Posted by Roger on 15 December 2010, 11:58 pm

When Wikileaks was first posted, I wondered to myself whether people with clearances could get themselves in trouble by viewing the website.   I was on vacation at the time, but 3 days later an email came out from the facility security officer.   Like many Federal government employees, we received a memo saying we cannot access those websites using company resources.   As the BlueCoat admin, I was asked to block access to Wikileaks.
Wikileaks has a number of different mirrors listed at wikileaks.info.   They have also asked individuals to mirror the site and announce the address via twitter.  Not wanting to play a game of wack-a-mole while on vacation I suggested to my colleague that he 1.  look at blocking everything with wikileaks in the domain name and 2) ask BlueCoat to categorize wikileaks as illegal/questionable.
BlueCoat just posted a blog entry about Wikileaks.   The post acknowledges that some organizations have expressed the desire to block wikileaks.   We’re not looking for a discussion of rightness or wrongness in blocking this.   Its our decision, just like blocking porn and not blocking shopping.   The BlueCoat WebFilter should be a tool allowing us to do this.   The writer of the BlueCoat blog believes BlueCoat webfilter does provide the flexibility for those who want to block wikileaks.   I dont agree.     UPDATE: BlueCoat now has a KB article on blocking wikileaks.   Option 2 is simple.   Its a static solution, but better than the block we put in.   Option 1 is blocking websites that are in both Political/Activist AND in NEWS/Media.   I’d have to do some testing to make sure that doesn’t have any collateral damage.   The remainder of my original post is below.   Also see the comments.
The issue here is BlueCoat incorrectly categorizes wikileaks as Political/Activist Groups and News/Media.   I’ve also seen it categorized as Reference.
Political/Activist contains sites like texasgop.org, aclu.org, rnc.org, dnc.org.  News/Media contains sites like cnn.com, foxnews.com, msnbc.msn.com.   WikiLeaks doesn’t fit in with these sites.   I can’t block those categories without a lot of collateral damage.
If BCWF put wikileaks into a category I could safely block, I could also rely on BlueCoat Webpulse to dynamically categorize all new wikileak mirrors.    Instead I’m left in the cold.   Not even a knowledgebase article on how to block it manually.
