Malwarebytes.org is now Malwarebytes.com
Over the last few weeks, you may have seen many of the assets on Malwarebytes.org transition to Malwarebytes.com. I’m here to clear up any confusion and put your mind at ease: You are on the right site!
Some of you might be wondering why a change in our web address is worth a blog post?
There are numerous methods of attack utilized by cybercriminals that send users to websites they didn’t intend to go to. For example, many forms of malware can redirect your web browser. When you think you are going to Google.com you actually end up going to google.badguy.com, a site that might include a drive-by exploit.
The usage of dot org on Malwarebytes goes back to 2008 when my co-founders and I launched the first version of the Malwarebytes Anti-Malware product. We had no idea at the time what Malwarebytes would become or how many scammers would try to utilize our name for nefarious purposes.
So, in an effort to make it even harder for the bad guys, we decided to finally adopt the dot com.
Oh, and typing in Malwarebytes.org will still bring you to us! Don’t worry about fake Malwarebytes pages if you make a typo.
Back in 2008, our mission was to disinfect and better protect people and businesses. That mission remains unchanged and I am excited now, more than ever, at the direction the company and our products are headed.
