Remember the LinkedIn exploits and malware serving campaigns which I profiled in March, and May?
Over the past 24 hours, cybercriminals launched the most recent spam campaign impersonating LinkedIn, in an attempt to trick LinkedIn’s users into clicking on the client-side exploits and malware serving links found in the emails.
More details:

Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 6c59e90d9c3931c900cfd2672f64aec3 currently detected by 4 out of 41 antivirus scanners as PWS-Zbot.gen.ajm; W32/Kryptik.BRK.
