DirectRev Advert Loads Self Sufficient Flash Exploit, CryptoWall
We have been observing a series of malvertising attacks using an unusual but familiar delivery method recently. Indeed, instead of relying on an exploit kit to compromise the victims’ machines, this technique simply relies on a disguised Flash advert that downloads its own exploit and payload.
We previously encountered this attack pattern on two occasions, one for a Sparta Ad and another that involved RTB platform DirectRev. This latest attack features various ad platforms leading to a booby trapped DirectRev ad.
The Flash exploit is hosted on sensentive.com:
