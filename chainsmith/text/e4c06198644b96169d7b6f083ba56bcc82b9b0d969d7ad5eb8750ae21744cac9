UFC.com blacklisted by Google (indirectly)

Anyone trying to visit the site UFC.com (from Google Chrome or Firefox) will get a big scary warning from Google:

Warning: Visiting this site may harm your computer!
The website at www.ufc.com contains elements from the site bin.clearspring.com, which appears to host malware – software that can hurt your computer or otherwise operate without your consent. Just visiting a site that contains malware can infect your computer.

They are getting indirectly blacklisted because they are loading content from bin.clearspring.com (an advertising network), which is currently blacklisted by Google for having malware.
As far as clearspring is concerned, it seems they’ve been hacked and the attacker has added malicious code to load malware from semaniseme.com and wenmo.in. So multiple levels of indirection here to affect UFC.com users.
Anyone else using clearspring should remove their code from their sites until they have this blacklist issue sorted out.
