Shoes Dropping May 8th

The Microsoft Security Response Center writes today that the DNS server patch is on target for May 8th.
“support for the legacy WSUSSCAN.CAB expired in March 2007, you need to ensure that your detection and deployment tools now support the new WSUSSCN2.CAB file. There will be no support for the security update for this issue in the old WSUSSCAN.CAB architecture. ”
If you use MBSA 2.0 in offline-scan mode, you will need to use MBSA 2.0.1. If you use the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates (ITMU), you need to ensure youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re using version 3 of that tool.
Next, a reminder that as part of our standard Microsoft Support Lifecycle, support for Windows Server 2003 expired on April 10, 2007 with the April monthly bulletin release. Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 are the currently supported versions.”
While I think the ITMU requirement came up last month, I suspect a lot of people will be caught flat footed with the Windows 2003 RTM expiration.
