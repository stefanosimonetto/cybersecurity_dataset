We continue to spot new cybercrime ecosystem propositions for spam-ready, cybercrime-friendly SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) targeting QA (Quality Assurance) aware cybercriminals looking to gain access to dedicated mail servers with clean IP reputation, ensuring that their campaigns will reach the recipient’s Inbox. Relying on ‘in-house’ built infrastructure or direct outsourcing to bulletproof hosting providers, these services continue empowering prospective customers with managed, popular spam software compatible services, potentially exposing millions of users to fraudulent or malicious email campaigns.
Let’s discuss yet another managed service offering spam-ready SMTP servers, and connect it to malicious campaigns that have directly interacted with the same infrastructure it’s currently hosted on, indicating that it’s already “in business”.

srub68.ru (92.53.125.90)
bloodyfight.net (92.53.125.90)
All of these sample establish a UDP communication channel to the following C&C server: 208.115.109.53:8010
How is the actual spamming and acquisition of the spam-ready infrastructure taking place? Through compromised Web sites. Consider going through this assessment of the actual malware used in these campaign courtesy of the fine folks at Abuse.ch.
