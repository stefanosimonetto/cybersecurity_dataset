According to the latest prenotification security advisory from Adobe, next week, the company plans to issue a ‘security update’ for Adobe Reader X (10.1.2) running on Windows, Linux and Macintosh.
Adobe’s products are under permanent fire from malicious cybercriminals, exploiting known vulnerabilities in Adobe’s products, who succeed, primarily relying on the fact that end and corporate users are not patching in a timely manner.
More details:

Affected software versions are as follows:

Adobe Reader X (10.1.2) and earlier 10.x versions for Windows and Macintosh
Adobe Reader 9.5 and earlier 9.x versions for Windows and Macintosh
Adobe Reader 9.4.6 and earlier 9.x versions for Linux
Adobe Acrobat X (10.1.2) and earlier 10.x versions for Windows and Macintosh
Adobe Acrobat 9.5 and earlier 9.x versions for Windows and Macintosh

According to third-party reports, end and corporate users are constantly exposed to online risks, due to the fact that they fail updating their Adobe software and browser plugins, potentially exposing themselves to the threats posed by web malware exploitation kits, such as the BlackHole exploit kit for instance.
Webroot’s security researchers recommend that end users ensure that they’re using the Web, while having the latest versions of their third-party software properly updated, next to their browser plugins. Moreover, users are also free to migrate to an alternative PDF software reader, such as the Foxit Reader for instance.
