Itâ€™s understoodâ€¦ that EU dudesâ€¦ sell GDPRizationâ€¦
June 28, 2018 in GDPR, Silly, Trivia

Iâ€™ve been recently thinking of GDPR, and its influence on the non-EU websitesâ€¦ in particular, I was curious how the legislation affects the user experience for non-EU sites for visitors from EU. We hear about many websites in US simply denying the access e.g. LA Times:

but I was curious how many other web sites really do soâ€¦
I came up with a quick & dirty (and pretty simple) idea of checking how the popular web sites respond to the regulationâ€¦ by visiting them and taking a screenshot.
Of course, manual check would be too labor-intensive, so I automated it.
First, I needed a list of top world web sites so I downloaded the Cisco Umbrella list. I know itâ€™s biased, but donâ€™t know any better source (since theÂ  free Alexa top 1M is long gone, and others â€“ I really donâ€™t know how accurate they are).
I then created a simple script in perl to extract the first 10000 top unique domains from the list (and exclude all subdomains on the way):
use strict;
use warnings;
my %h;
my $cnt=0;
while (<>)
{
if (/,([^\.]+\.[^\.]+$)/)
{
if (!defined($h{$1}))
{
print "$1";
$h{$1}++;
$cnt++;
exit if $cnt >= 10000;
}
}
}

Next, I wrote a simple phantomjs script to grab a screenshot of these domains (all accessed via http and then rerunning for https for these that didnâ€™t work):
system = require('system')
var page = require('webpage').create();
page.viewportSize = { width: 1024, height: 768 };
page.clipRect = { top: 0, left: 0, width: 1024, height: 768 };
address = system.args[1];
output  = system.args[2];
page.open(address, function() {
page.render(output);
phantom.exit();
});

And then I ran the phantomjs on domains from this data setâ€¦ each page visited is saved as a png.
To my surprise, the experiment didnâ€™t work as I anticipated.
Most of web sites visited didnâ€™t really make any comment on GDPR and it was business as usual. Some offer an option to accept new privacy policies. In the end I only came up with a bunch of examples.
Still, it was worth tryingâ€¦
Lessons learnedâ€¦

Some web sites detect phantom JS as a bot â€“ they will block your IP, or offer a captcha challenge
Lots of top domains donâ€™t even host a web site; you can see default IIS, Nginx pages, errors (404, 403s ;))
Privacy banners, if they exist, are handled in many different ways â€“ from simple OK, to more advanced settings with a multi-choice questionnaire; I include some example below
Many non-English web sites provide information about privacy in their native language; this is an interesting conundrum to solve in general â€“ how a non-speaker can use the web site w/o an ability to understand the Privacy Policies? I provide some examples in French, Italian and Dutch (and of course, English)
Way too many advertising and marketing web sites, all united to promise you the best monetization ever; and yes, AI-based advertising is already here ðŸ™‚

I am wondering if the methodology I used was incorrect? Perhaps it would be faster to just query google for all the web sites that refer to GDPR? I couldnâ€™t come up with a good google dork though. And searching still brings many of such geo-locked web sites and include them in â€˜normalâ€™ results. You only learn about GDPR stuff when you try to visit the actual page. Google cache is still available though in some cases. Soâ€¦ I guess this transitional stage will last for some time. If you have any idea on how to run a research like this better, please let me know.
