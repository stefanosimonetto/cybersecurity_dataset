Recent cyber events are a stark reminder that our work as defenders is never done. Critical 
vulnerabilities such as “Log4Shell” highlight the dangers of the unknown and the complexity of 
patching. The supply chain is as attractive a target as ever, providing a potential entry point into 
multiple vendors. And we must remain vigilant about protecting our industrial control systems, 
especially given that 1 in 7   multifaceted extortion attacks leak critical operational technology 
information.

Let’s start with a win for defenders: the global median dwell time has continued its decline 
in 2021. For intrusions investigated between October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, the 
median number of days between compromise and detection was 21 days (down from 24 days in 
2020). Although this may demonstrate improved visibility and response, the pervasiveness of 
ransomware has helped drive this number down.

In APAC and EMEA, the majority of intrusions in 2021 were identified externally--a 
reversal of what was observed in 2020. The detection by source for Americas held 
steady with most intrusions continuing to be detected internally.
[Word Count: 36]

Across the board, there was an increase in external notification of intrusions in 
2021 compared to 2020. However, awareness of most intrusions continues to 
come about through internal detections. The percentage of intrusions detected 
internally has maintained a gradual upwards trend with moderate fluctuation over 
the last six years.

Organizations in APAC were notified by an external entity in 76% of intrusions in 
2021 compared to 48% of intrusions in 2020. Observations for 2021 are in line with 
observations for APAC from 2019. Mandiant experts have seen relatively large

[Word Count: 53]

In EMEA, organizations were notified of an incident by an external entity in 62% 
of intrusions in 2021 compared to 47% of intrusions in 2020. Similar to APAC, when 
analyzing the five-year trend, there remains variability in detection by source in 
EMEA. The variability observed for both APAC and EMEA can be explained in part 
by continued maturity of organizations’ security programs as well as external

The global median dwell time continued to improve in 2021 with organizations now 
detecting intrusions in three weeks. The global median dwell time for organizations 
that learned about their security incident through an external third party notification 
improved markedly in 2021. Not only are external entities doing more notifications 
of intrusions to organizations compared to 2020, they are also notifying them 
more quickly, resulting in shorter dwell times. The median dwell time for internally 
detected intrusions lengthened in 2021 compared to 2020 but remained shorter than 
median dwell time for external notifications.
[Word Count: 92]

The global median dwell time for 2021 was 21 days compared to 24 days in 2020. This 
13% improvement in global median dwell time was comprised of noteworthy changes 
in relation to source of detection. The global median dwell time for incidents which 
were identified externally dropped from 73 to 28 days. Conversely, incidents which 
were identified internally saw a lengthening of global median dwell time from 
12 to 18 days.
[Word Count: 71]

There were significant improvements to global median dwell time when an external 
entity was the notification source. External entities are now detecting intrusions 
and notifying organizations in less than a month—62% faster compared to 2020. This 
speaks to improved detection capabilities of external entities in addition to more 
established communications and outreach programs.
[Word Count: 53]

Mandiant experts observed a 50% increase in global median dwell time for internally 
detected intrusions. The global median dwell time for internally detected intrusions 
rose from 12 days in 2020 to 18 days in 2021. While median dwell time for internal 
detections was slower compared to 2020, internal detections were still 36% faster

Global dwell time distribution continues to improve at both ends of the spectrum. 
In 2021, 55% of investigations had dwell times of 30 days or fewer with 67% of these 
(37% of total intrusions) being discovered in one week or less.
[Word Count: 41]

Mandiant experts observed a spike in dwell times between 90 and 300 days with 
20% of investigations falling into this range. This could indicate intrusions going 
undetected until more impactful actions occur in the environment following initial 
infection and reconnaissance phases of the targeted attack lifecycle. This may also 
highlight a disparity between organizational detection capabilities and the types of 
attacks organizations face.
[Word Count: 63]

Fewer intrusions are going undetected for extensive periods of time. Only 8% of

“code overlap” among the members that 
Mandiant considers them to be the same 
thing, a “family”. The term family broadens

largest malware family category observed during Mandiant investigations over 
the years. Of the 365 malware families observed in 2021, the top categories were 
backdoors (40%), droppers (12%), ransomware (10%), downloaders (7%), credential 
stealers (5%) and launchers (4%).
[Word Count: 48]

Similar to newly tracked malware families, 22% of observed malware families in 2021 
were comprised of the "other" malware family category. Compared to previous years, 
this number remains stable as adversaries create and use a variety of different tools 
to achieve their missions.

privately developed.
[Word Count: 35]

Observed Malware Families by Availability, 2021
[Word Count: 6]

Similar to availability for newly tracked malware families, Mandiant experts 
observed 72% of malware families used by adversaries during an intrusion in 2021 
were non-public and 28% were publicly available. Adversaries use both publicly and 
non-publicly available malware to accomplish missions across intrusions. While 
many adversaries often use the same publicly available malware families such as 
BEACON, Mandiant continues see adversaries innovate and adapt to be effective in 
victim environments.
[Word Count: 70]

A non-public tool or code family 
is, to the best of our knowledge, 
not publicly available (either for 
free or for sale). They may include 
tools that are privately developed, 
held or used, as well as tools that 
are shared among or sold to a 
restricted set of customers.
[Word Count: 49]

A publicly available tool or code 
family is readily obtainable without 
restriction. This includes tools that 
are freely available on the Internet, 
as well as tools that are sold or 
purchased, as long as they can be 
purchased by any buyer.

The malware families seen most frequently during intrusions investigated by 
Mandiant experts were BEACON, SUNBURST, METASPLOIT, SYSTEMBC, LOCKBIT 
and RYUK.  BEACON was once again the most prevalent malware family observed 
in 2021—three times more often than the second most frequently seen malware 
family. Further, use of BEACON across intrusions increased from 24% of intrusions 
in 2020 to 28% in 2021. BEACON remains by far the favorite malware family among 
adversaries and Mandiant expects its use will likely increase in the years to come.
[Word Count: 83]

SUNBURST¹² was observed in 9% of all intrusions investigated by Mandiant in 2021. 
SUNBURST was delivered at scale to victim environments across the globe through a 
malicious update, resulting in widespread compromised access. This metric is in line 
with the observed relationship between the second most prevalent initial infection 
vector, supply chain compromises and the use of SUNBURST in intrusions.
[Word Count: 60]

RYUK and LOCKBIT were the most used ransomware families during intrusions 
investigated by Mandiant in 2021. Notably, newly graduated FIN12¹³ leveraged 
RYUK, BEACON, SYSTEMBC and METASPLOIT to carry out some of the most prolific 
intrusions seen throughout 2021. Ransomware families continue to contribute to the 
malware family collection every year.
[Word Count: 50]

Adversaries continue to use a variety of malware to carry out missions. In 2021, 
Mandiant observed just 3.8% of malware families being used in 10 or more intrusions 
while 81% of malware families were observed in only one or two intrusions. Over 
the years, Mandiant has observed adversary toolsets become more diverse 
as adversaries continue to evolve. This diversification is demonstrated by a 
continuation of limited retooling across intrusions.

BEACON is a backdoor that is commercially available as part of the Cobalt Strike 
software platform and commonly used for penetration testing network environments. 
The malware supports several capabilities, such as injecting and executing arbitrary 
code, uploading and downloading files and executing shell commands. Mandiant has 
seen BEACON used by a wide range of named threat groups including APT19, APT32, 
APT40, APT41, FIN6, FIN7, FIN9, FIN11, FIN12 and FIN13, as well as nearly 650 UNC 
groups.
[Word Count: 76]

SUNBURST is a .NET-based backdoor that initially communicates via DNS. SUNBURST 
generates the domain of the initial remote server using a domain generation 
algorithm. The DNS response returns a CNAME record containing the domain of the C2 
server used for subsequent communication via HTTP. Supported backdoor commands 
include file download and execution, file management, registry manipulation, and 
process termination. SUNBURST can also disable targeted services to avoid detection 
and upload basic system information that includes the system’s IP address, DHCP 
configuration, and domain information. Mandiant has observed UNC2452 leverage 
SUNBURST.¹⁴
[Word Count: 90]

METASPLOIT is a penetration testing platform that enables users to find, exploit, and 
validate vulnerabilities. Mandiant has seen METASPLOIT used by APT40, APT41, FIN6, 
FIN7, FIN11, FIN12, FIN13 and 40 UNC groups with end goals ranging from espionage 
and financial gain to penetration testing.
[Word Count: 44]

LOCKBIT is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored locally and on network 
shares. LOCKBIT can also identify additional systems on a network and propagate 
via SMB. Prior to encrypting files, LOCKBIT clears event logs, deletes volume shadow 
copies and terminates processes and services that may impact its ability to encrypt 
files. LOCKBIT has been observed using the file extension “.lockbit” for encrypted 
files. Mandiant as seen LOCKBIT used by more than 10 UNC groups with goals relating 
to financial gain and espionage.
[Word Count: 84]

RYUK is ransomware written in C that encrypts files stored on local drives and 
network shares. It also deletes backup files and volume shadow copies. Some RYUK 
variants can propagate to other systems on a network. Mandiant has seen RYUK used 
by FIN6, FIN12 and 10 financially motivated UNC groups.

MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally-
accessible knowledge base of 
adversary tactics and techniques 
based on real-world observations. 
The ATT&CK knowledge base 
is used as a foundation for the 
development of specific threat 
models and methodologies in the 
private sector, government and 
the cyber security product and 
service community.
[Word Count: 48]

Mandiant remains committed to supporting community and industry efforts by 
mapping its findings to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. In 2021, MITRE released 
versions 9 and 10 of ATT&CK, which focused on advancement of MITRE’s coverage of 
Linux, macOS and container techniques. Mandiant mapped 300+ additional Mandiant 
techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework in 2021, bringing the total to 2100+ 
Mandiant techniques and subsequent findings associated with MITRE ATT&CK.
[Word Count: 68]

Organizations must prioritize which security measures to implement and the 
likelihood of specific techniques being used during an intrusion should impact this 
decision-making process. Examining the prevalence of technique usage during 
recent intrusions, can better equip organizations to make intelligent security 
decisions.
[Word Count: 42]

Mandiant experts observed adversaries use 70% of MITRE ATT&CK techniques 
and 46% of sub-techniques during an intrusion in 2021. Compared to 2020, this 
represents an 11% increase in techniques observed and a 92% increase in sub-
techniques observed. While this is representative of adversaries using a wider 
variety of techniques to further intrusions, Mandiant experts believe this increase 
is due in part to more robust classification and systematic categorization of threat 
data that was implemented in 2021.
[Word Count: 77]

In 2021, 43% of techniques observed (30% of all techniques) were seen in more 
than 5% of intrusions compared to 37% of techniques observed in 2020 (23% of all 
techniques in 2020). Mandiant experts recommend prioritizing implementation of 
security measures to protect against the most commonly used techniques over 
techniques with a lower prevalence.

[Word Count: 7]

In 2021, Mandiant observed that more than half of the intrusions used obfuscation, 
such as encryption or encoding, on files or information to make detection and 
subsequent analysis more difficult (T1027).
[Word Count: 31]

Adversaries also continue to use a command or scripting interpreter to further 
intrusions (T1059) and 65% of those cases (29% of all intrusions) involved the use of 
PowerShell (T1059.001).
[Word Count: 29]

In 37% of investigations the adversary communicated using application layer 
protocols (T1071) with 87% of those (32% of all investigations) specifically using web 
protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS.
[Word Count: 29]

Mandiant experts observed adversaries perform discovery actions for system 
information (T1082) in 32% of investigations and file or directory information 
(T1083) also in 32% of investigations. Similarly, in 32% of investigations adversaries 
removed indicators on a host (T1070) with 85% of these (27% of all investigations) 
involving file deletions.
[Word Count: 49]

Similar to 2020, adversaries demonstrated a willingness to take advantage of 
what is available in a victim’s environment to further intrusions in 2021. This is 
particularly evident in how frequently adversaries used web protocols, PowerShell, 
system services and Remote Desktop. Organizations must balance convenience 
and accessibility of common technologies with security of environments.

SPECIAL REPORT | MANDIANT M-TRENDS 2022
41
[Word Count: 7]

The cyber threat landscape is vast and deep and regularly influenced by the world 
around us. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, we observed an uptick in targeting 
of healthcare and research and development. Now, at the time of publishing M-Trends 
2022, the situation unfolding in Ukraine shows how tightly the geopolitical and cyber 
worlds are intertwined.
[Word Count: 56]

Our mission at Mandiant is to ensure every organization is secure from cyber threats 
and confident in their readiness. The annual M-Trends report represents significant 
effort towards advancing that mission with the use of data and learnings from our 
incident response engagements.
[Word Count: 42]

The global median dwell time is now 21 days, down from 24 days last year, which is 
a downward trend we like to see. A trend we don’t like to see is the continued use of 
ransomware and multifaceted extortion. With low risks and barrier to entry and high 
rewards, we see this as an ongoing threat posing a risk to every organization.
[Word Count: 63]

Preparation is vital not just for ransomware but all types of attacks, whether through 
red teaming, tabletop exercises, training or other techniques. Sound fundamentals, 
such as vulnerability and patch management, least privilege and hardening also play 
a role in building strong defenses. Our case study involving coinminers illustrates the 
value of logging and following up on alerts, since the investigation eventually led to 
even more significant threats.
[Word Count: 67]

The heart of any cyber defense capability is the intelligence that drives it, and the 
best threat intelligence is gleaned directly from the frontlines. Mandiant will continue 
to share its frontline knowledge in M-Trends to improve our collective security 
awareness, understanding and capabilities—and to ensure that organizations can stay 
relentless in their cyber security efforts.
[Word Count: 55]

Since 2004, Mandiant® has been a trusted partner to security-conscious 
organizations. Today, industry-leading Mandiant threat intelligence and 
expertise drive dynamic solutions that help organizations develop more 
effective programs and instill confidence in their cyber readiness.
