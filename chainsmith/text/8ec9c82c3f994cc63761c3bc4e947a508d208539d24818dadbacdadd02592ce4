ASTARO SECURITY LINUX 2.0 BETA – Announcement – June 25, 2001
We are pleased to announce the beta version of the next major release of Astaro Security Linux. There are quite a few new features and system improvements included – we would appreciate your test feedback to help us bringing out a rock stable 2.0 soon! Please post your feedback in the therefore specific board at www.astaro.org  – thanks.

New in Astaro Security Linux 2.0 Beta:

SCSI Hardisk support
Road warrior-VPNs via PPTP
WebAdmin allows to kick open sessions
TCP port of WebAdmin is configurable
Handling of infected emails via WebAdmin
Portscan detection configurable via WebAdmin
Beeps after booting or halting
Separate virus pattern updates
Backup-files can be emailed (Attention: unencrypted!)
Different keyboard layouts
Selfsigned SSL certificate generation
Remote Syslog/SNMP (no WebAdmin so far)

Up2Dates for upgrading from 1.8 will be provided for the stable 2.0, not the beta version. The upgrade to 2.0 is free of charge for all 1.8 customers! Backup will work for 1.8 -> Beta -> 2.0 migration.
Non-commercial users please note that it will not be possible to activate SMTP virus protection without a valid license key anymore – Astaro sublicenses the virus scanner from Kapersky Labs. We will announce a special virus protection-pricing for non-commercial users with the 2.0 release.
