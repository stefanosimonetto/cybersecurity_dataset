Virus of the day

Posted by Roger on 18 January 2007, 6:06 pm

Today’s virus of the day is being detected as win32.small.dam in our inbound email.
The recipient addresses so far are very old. I guess this is one spammer group that hasn’t been sold our corporate addressbook.
The only reason I mention the virus, is the lurid subject lines got a laugh out of me.
“U.S. Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice has kicked German Chancellor Angela Merkel”
other subjects:
“Naked teens attack home director”
“British Muslims Genocide”
Attachment named “full clip.exe” and video.exe
Here’s a link to F-Secure’s blog entry on this virus.
