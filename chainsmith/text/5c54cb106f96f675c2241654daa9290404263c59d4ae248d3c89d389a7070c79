Microsoft patches 15 important vulnerabilities

This month, Microsoft issued 5 security bulletins covering 15 vulnerabilities in Excel and Windows. These updates are considered important rather than critical, as by the time of the patch there was no malicious code exploiting the vulnerabilities in the wild. Adobe also released a security bulletin patching 13 vulnerabilities in Acrobat Reader. Websense® Security Labs highly recommends applying the updates in order to avoid cyber criminals who may use these security holes for their malicious activities.

Arguably the most important bulletin is MS11-072, which targets five different vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. An attacker could use any of these to execute arbitrary code on the computer with the same access rights as the user. This is a focus for any security researcher as hackers are constantly looking for newer ways to distribute their badware. Such issues are probably getting more and more headlines as Adobe's sandboxing system and regular security patches seem to be paying off, meaning an up-to-date system is much less prone to successful exploits by vulnerabilities in PDFs.

This does not mean, of course, that we will see no more vulnerabilities in Acrobat Reader. This Tuesday Adobe Issued a security bulletin too, fixing 13 vulnerability issues in their product. Each of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute a code on the host computer allowing them to take full control of it. This patch is rated as critical, therefore it is strongly recommended to apply it.

Also worth mentioning is that many companies have updated their DigiNotar certificates - Microsoft, Adobe, and even Mozilla Firefox issued the updates. Firefox even released an additional security patch targeting this issue. Please check that you have applied the latest updates so you are fully protected.

Is your organization using the latest Firefox 6 or Internet Explorer 9? Which one did you find more secure? Give us your thoughts in the comments.
