“INTUIT Security Warning” Emails Lead to Fake Browser Update Malware
Users of popular accounting software Quickbooks should keep an eye out for this fake “Intuit Security Warning” themed email currently in circulation, encouraging you to update your browser with a zipped download.

The email reads as follows:
INTUIT Security Warning

As of November 5th, 2015, we will be updating the browsers we support. We encourage you to upgrade to the latest version for the best online experience. Please proceed the following link, download and install the security update for all supported browsers to be on top with INTUIT online security!
The supplied URL is
intuit(dot)updates(dot)securityserver-2(dot)com
The site detects which browser you’re using, and offers up an appropriately themed browser download offer. So, for example, here’s the Firefox splash screen complete with an “Update the browser please” style message:

Looks like you're using an older version of Firefox, update to stay fast and safe
Here’s the Chrome variant, with yet more tidings of outdated browser antics:

You are currently running a browser that appears to be out of date
Users of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware will find we detect the file(s) as Trojan.Downloader.
If in doubt whenever seemingly dodgy emails bearing gifts are concerned, you should visit the official website of the product in question and contact support.
Generally speaking, anytime you receive random emails claiming tales of browser updates along with offers of downloads (zipped or otherwise) you should treat them with caution. As long as you’re in control of the flow of events – by taking the initiative and manually visiting the real thing, instead of just clicking through on links handed to you – things will likely pan out in your favour.
