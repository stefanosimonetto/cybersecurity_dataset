Another launcher from Dell is presented below. Similarly to the one I described earlier, it relies on an .ini file named after the main .exe. This time the commands can be selected depending on an OS version though e.g.:
[CommandLine] Command_x86=java.exe Command_XP_x64=java.exe Command_2003_x64=java.exe Command_VISTA_x64=java.exe
