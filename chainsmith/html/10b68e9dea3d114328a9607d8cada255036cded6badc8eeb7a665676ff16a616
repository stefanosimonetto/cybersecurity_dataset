While some vendors submitted dedicated server, or at least business-oriented versions of their products, several entries comprised much the same products as appear in desktop platform tests, which should be assumed to work perfectly well in the <em class="productname">Server 2003</em> environment.</p><p>With time pressing (a post holiday season illness meaning things got under way even later than originally planned), I could only hope for simple installation procedures, easily navigated configuration systems and solid, stable operation. Past experience has, of course, taught me that this was a little too much to hope for, but I went into the lab with my fingers crossed.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2654355"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p><em class="productname">Windows Server 2003</em> bears great similarity to <em class="productname">XP</em> (on which it is based) - with a number of adjustments to the default settings providing a little extra security - and the process of setting up the test systems presented few difficulties.</p><p>The deadline for product submission was the first Monday of the year, 7 January, with the content of the test sets frozen the preceding Friday. Rather hasty pre-Christmas preparations for the review meant that my usual check of significant calendar events was omitted, and the product submission deadline coincided unwittingly with Russian Orthodox Christmas celebrations and Christmas in some other areas, but vendors based in these territories still managed to get their products in without too much grumbling.</p><p>The test sets were based on the November issue of the WildList (released in mid-December), which included a fairly standard number of additions heavily dominated by worms with familiar names, or at least behaviours. There were once again a handful of polymorphic file-infectors, including several of the W32/Virut variants which caused such mayhem in the last test. A fairly large number of items also fell from the list and were thus relegated to other test sets.</p><p>These other sets were subject to minimal updating, due to the shortage of time for preparations, and the clean set was also expanded in only a minor way, with a few dozen packages and their contents added. With limited changes from the test sets used in the last round of testing, I hoped for considerably better performance from the products this time around.</p><p>In addition to testing basic detection performance, we have once again included tests of the products&rsquo; archive scanning depth, both in default settings and with more complex scanning options enabled. Only products which could be cajoled into detecting the EICAR test sample hidden three levels deep in archives are included in the tables for these sets, and only those spotting the test string in a file with a randomly selected extension appear on the &lsquo;all files&rsquo; tables (although in some cases this only indicates that products are getting file type information from within files rather than simply from the extension, and full scanning may not always be occurring). We hope that the data provides some insight into the efficiency of the products under test.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2129598"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3995869"></a>AEC Trustport Antivirus 2.8.0.1628</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AEC</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Trustport</em> suite contains a number of items beyond the anti-virus component, but as usual only this module was submitted for testing. This made installation a pretty straightforward process, and left me with no main interface from which to operate &ndash; configuration and functions are instead accessed from a system tray menu. The default settings are pretty thorough, detecting everything in our archive and file-extension scanning test set, and combined with the multi-engine layout this led to some rather languid scanning times.</p><p><em class="phrase">AEC</em>&rsquo;s entry in the last comparative review (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2007/12/vb-comparative-review-windows-2000-professional
" target="_top">VB, December 2007, p.16</a>), its first since the <em class="productname">BitDefender</em> engine was dropped from the product in favour of those of <em class="productname">Dr.Web</em> and <em class="productname">VirusBlokAda</em>, suffered from some false positive issues as well as several WildList misses. Detection was greatly improved this time, with nothing at all missed on demand, and only a few older items missed on access (where not all the available engines are used by default). However, despite one of the engines apparently being disabled entirely, and greyed out in configuration dialogs, several false positives were recorded, which once again deny <em class="phrase">AEC</em> a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>100.00%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4713312"></a>Agnitum Outpost Security Suite Pro 6.0.2227.232.0465</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Agnitum</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Outpost</em> was subject to an in-depth review last month (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2008/01/agnitum-outpost-security-suite-pro-2008
" target="_top">VB, January 2008, p.17</a>), after achieving its first VB100 certification in the previous comparative. With the review still fresh in my mind, the installation process and configuration were fairly straightforward, although the product is sufficiently well designed to present few difficulties for those without any prior knowledge. </p><p>The available configuration is somewhat limited, with no option to scan archives in on-access mode, but other files did seem to be inspected regardless of their extension, and speeds were fairly reasonable considering. False positives were entirely absent, and detection in most of the test sets at the pretty high level expected from the <em class="productname">VirusBuster</em> engine in use. In the WildList set, however, a single instance of a W32/VB worm was missed, as well as two samples of one of the new W32/Virut variants. This presaged problems for some of the products further down the list using the same technology, and meant <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em> didn&rsquo;t quite manage to add to its VB100 tally.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.80%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.80%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>85.91%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4548339"></a>AhnLab V3Net for Windows Server 6.1.21.711</h3></div></div></div><p><span><em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> has not been a regular participant in VB100 tests recently, but the AVAR conference the company hosted in Seoul a few weeks before the test deadline provided an opportunity to pester the developers into joining in again &ndash; an effort which paid off with this entry.</span></p><p><span>The <em class="productname">V3Net</em> product is quick and easy to install and set up, with a clear and pleasant interface adorned with a touch of cartoonishness without seeming too silly. The configuration is a little lacking on access, with no option to delve inside archives in this mode &ndash; something which seemed a little odd in a dedicated server product, as one might expect experienced admins to be interested in having a fuller range of options available. Even in on-demand mode, where most archive types were examined quite deeply, self-extracting executables and installer files were omitted. Another oddity which may cause admins frustration is the format of logs, which record only filenames with no information as to where the files in question may be found &ndash; this made for considerably more work in processing the test results.</span></p><p><span>Detection itself was less of an issue. No false positives were recorded and, despite a handful of misses in some of the older test sets, nothing significant was missed in the WildList set, thus <em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> earns a VB100 award on its return to the test bench.</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>98.99%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>92.88%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3468544"></a>Alwil avast!

All the required configuration was readily available, with the defaults set not to scan archives internally but options available to scan the full range of archive types included in our test sets. Oddly, the renamed version of the EICAR test file was spotted on access but not on demand, implying that the on-access scanner is set up a little more thoroughly than the normally more in-depth manual scans.</p><p>Speeds were impressive, and still fairly decent with the more complete scanning options enabled.

The interface was not as simple to navigate and use as <em class="phrase">Avira</em>&rsquo;s desktop range, but seems to provide a pretty thorough range of controls for the administrator. On-access scanning was fairly straightforward, and thorough once fuller scanning was enabled, although a few files compressed with the ACE algorithm were missed despite more deeply nested samples of the same format being detected.</span></p><p><span>Some very good speeds were recorded in both modes, although the actual setup and running of on-demand scans took much more time, with a rather awkward and fiddly setup process, and no indication of scanning progress at all. Once the complexities of the design were cracked, scan results showed the product&rsquo;s usual excellent detection rates and no false positives, giving <em class="phrase">Avira</em> another VB100 award.</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.87%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3298866"></a>BitDefender Security for Windows Server 2.4.227</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="productname">BitDefender</em> also provided a special server version for this test, again incorporating a console interface using the MMC framework. This seemed rather more logically laid out and took less effort to decipher, but also seemed to be missing some useful options. The on-access scanner, for example, seemed to offer no option to block access only, making this action available only after attempts at other &lsquo;cleaning&rsquo; methods had failed. This resulted in my test collection being trashed and requiring restoration between tests. Another apparent failing was an issue with setting up on-demand scans. Assuming at first that these could again only be run from the scheduler, I set up a scan using the default time offered, which was in fact the current time &ndash; ideal for my needs.

This is another .NET product, again at a fairly early stage in its development, and some flakiness is evident in the running of the interface, with occasional unexpected shutdowns and the odd error message, particularly when trying to access logs. Configuration is extremely minimal here, with the controls accessible from the system tray icon limited to running a scan and shutting down the on-access scanner. With the &lsquo;default&rsquo; settings provided in the form of a series of registry keys it is here that adjustments must be made if needed &ndash; changing the default on-access behaviour (which seems to be to prompt users with a message offering not to delete if they respond within 30 seconds) seems not always to respond as expected, interrupting a few scans with its warnings.</p><p><span>After some struggles extracting scan data from a series of XML files and allowing the on-access scanner to delete most of the infected test set, results were obtained.

The freezes were resolved by killing the process with the Task Manager, which brought up an increasing number of alert messages from <em class="phrase">Symantec</em>&rsquo;s anti-tamper system, informing me that attempts to shut it down had been &lsquo;blocked&rsquo; &ndash; in one instance, after several dozen of these messages protection was in fact stopped and the interface restarted.</p><p>These minor issues, likely due to the generation of a log exceeding 150 MB, did little to affect the results themselves however. Scan times were fairly good, with on-demand defaults delving three levels deep into most archives and more available. The on-access scanner seemed to offer only limited configuration but did identify disguised file types.

This included options which seemed to imply archives would be scanned internally on access, but apparently only cover normal executables renamed as archives to conceal their intentions (which would be ignored in the default modes). </p><p>The interface itself is pleasant if a little fiddly when setting up scans, and suffers a tendency to linger a little over saving its logs, even those with minimal content. This did little to dent a good performance in terms of both speed and detection, with no false alarms and the W32/Virut samples missed by the other products using the same engine causing no difficulties here &ndash; presumably due to a slightly later version of the detection data. However, one remaining item, a W32/VB worm variant, was missed, and although we are advised that detection was added to the product a week or so after the submission deadline, the missed detection prevents <em class="phrase">VirusBuster</em> from attaining a VB100 award this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.82%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.82%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>85.91%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4549052"></a>Webroot SpySweeper AntiSpyware with AntiVirus Corporate Edition 3.50.3578</h3></div></div></div><p>Last on the list of products comes <em class="phrase">Webroot</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">SpySweeper</em>. This is <em class="productname">SpySweeper</em> &rsquo;s second visit to the <span class="emphasis"><em>VB</em></span> test bench, having made its debut &ndash; and gained VB100 status &ndash; in the June 2007 XP review (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2007/06/vb-comparative-review-windows-xp-sp2
" target="_top">VB, June 2007, p.10</a>). The corporate version submitted here was considerably different from the home-user edition submitted previously. </p><p>After a rather drawn out installation and startup process, the product offers a fairly comprehensive interface with some apparently well-populated configuration pages. Unfortunately, these are initially greyed out, as the client system submitted is designed to cede all control to a management server. Some changes to the registry allowed access to the settings (after providing a password) and testing continued.</p><p>Problems did not end there however, as the on-demand scanner seemed to provide no option to scan only a given folder and the entire system had to be scanned &ndash; no small job in this case. On returning after leaving the scan running overnight I found that the test sets had been covered pretty thoroughly, and they were then replaced before attempting the on-access tests. These were again hampered by the product&rsquo;s rather unusual implementation, with on-read scanning deactivated by default and only functioning rather flakily once enabled. This rendered any speed results gathered somewhat suspect, and only detection results were obtained by copying all test sets to the system across the network.</p><p> As far as can be judged by feeling alone, the protection did seem to slow the machine&rsquo;s response time down noticeably, especially during the five or so minutes after a reboot when the system tray icon is whirring and the interface unavailable (presumably doing some sort of boot-up checks.) After several attempts yielded a usable log of detection, results turned out to be pretty good - close to the high level expected of the <em class="productname">Sophos</em> engine used in the product - bar a few file types not scanned with these settings. Without false positives either, <em class="phrase">Webroot</em> earns another VB100 award this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>99.93%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>100.00%</div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4609526"></a>Results tables</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/02/on-demand.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/02/an-access.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/02/ondemand_throughput.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/02/throughputgraph.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/02/fileaccess_lag.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/02/archive.gif" /></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3657116"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div></div><p>After the deluge of problems detecting a handful of nasty polymorphic viruses in the last round of testing, it was good to see far better coverage of the WildList this time. Most products seemed to have resolved their issues with these items, with a small handful of the latest worms causing the majority of difficulties this month.</p><p>False positives hit a cluster of other products, but few suffered any major issues with false alerting, most only flagging single files. With only a small number of packages added to the clean test set this month, this was to be expected. Many of the problems were with files that have been in the set for some time without causing any problems, which suggests that adjustments to heuristics are the main cause of the niggles.</p><p>The addition of the archive scanning test, intended as an adjunct to the speed test to indicate how speed times are affected by the depth of scanning, has also provided some information on the breadth of configuration available in products. Running a server-based test, we expected to draw in mostly enterprise-level products, which one would expect to offer considerably more flexibility than home-user offerings. Enterprise admins have far more complex and varying requirements than the simpler needs of the home user, with marked differences in network layout and system uses from company to company, widely varying company policies to comply with and so on. By limiting the choices offered to their users and admins, some products may risk limiting their usefulness in the corporate arena.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2617126"></a>Technical details</h2></div></div></div><p><b>Test environment.&nbsp;</b>Tests were run on identical machines with <em class="productname">AMD Athlon64 3800+</em> dual core processors, 1GB RAM, 40GB and 200 GB dual hard disks, DVD/CD-ROM and 3.5-inch floppy drive, all running <em class="productname">Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition R2 SP2</em>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Any developers interested in submitting products for VB&#39;s comparative reviews should contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1e7471767030767f697b6d5e68776c6b6d7c6a70307d7173" target="_top"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="19737671773771786e7c6a596f706b6c6a7b6d77377a7674">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
