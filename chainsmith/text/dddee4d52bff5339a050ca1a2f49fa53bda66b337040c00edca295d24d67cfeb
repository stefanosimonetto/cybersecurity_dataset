Large Angler Malvertising Campaign Hits Top Publishers
During the past few weeks, malvertising activity was a little bit on the decline, at least within our own telemetry. We were mainly seeing the usual suspects pushing a lot of Magnitude EK related infections and the occasional tech support scam.
However, out of the blue on the weekend we witnessed a huge spike in malicious activity emanating out of two suspicious domains. Not only were there a lot of events, but they also included some very high profile publishers, which is something we haven’t seen in a while:

Payload:
The first couple of days before this campaign went big, we observed a few hits on smaller publishers that were pushing the RIG exploit kit:

On Sunday, when the attack really expanded, the Angler exploit kit was then used:

Angler EK has gone through several changes lately, in its URI patterns but also in the landing page itself. It is also the only one to use a recently patched Silverlight vulnerability.
Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit blocks the malvertising attack when it launches the exploit kit:

We notified the various ad networks when we first identified the attack as well as CloudFlare; we will update this blog with any new relevant information.
