Neutrino EK: more Flash trickery
A while back we wrote about the Neutrino exploit kit performing fingerprinting checks to weed out security researchers and honeypots attempting to catch its payload. Interestingly, it did this from within the same Flash exploit it uses to compromise the system. The EK developers really have a special relationship with the Flash player, having counted on it for a long time as their primary weapon up until integrating an Internet Explorer zero-day.
Continuing with that trend, we recently observed a new redirection pattern from compromised websites, and, you may have guessed, it uses a Flash file.

It is not the EITest campaign though, which does have an intermediary redirection mechanism with Flash. Instead, the rogue SWF file is hosted on the hacked website, and for all intents and purposes looks innocuous as it hides in plain sight within other media types.

Additionally, this Flash file performs the same fingerprinting that we saw before within the Neutrino exploit kit itself. In other words, they have duplicated this check and placed it up the infection chain to filter out fake traffic before it even reaches the gate to the EK.

If the various conditions are met (no Virtual Machine, no AV installed, etc), another piece of code within that SWF file takes care of performing the redirection to an external URL, a gate to Neutrino EK’s landing. The troubled ExternalInterface.call() fires __flash__toXML, which instructs the Flash file to write a malicious iframe into the browser:

This gate launches Neutrino EK which still performs the same fingerprinting (not all paths to Neutrino include this pre-check, so it makes sense to keep it at the EK level as well).
As we can see, Neutrino EK and some of its gates continue to rely on the Flash Player as they incorporate more useful features to keep infections stealthy and less discoverable. There is one clear advantage to using Flash’s ActionScript code rather than plain, or even obfuscated JavaScript, in that reversing Flash files is more time consuming and tedious.
