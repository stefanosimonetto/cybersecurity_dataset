WordPress 3.5 Released

Update like it’s hot!
Today marks the release of WordPress 3.5 (Named Elvin after jazz drimmer Elvin Jones), a major release this year for the WordPress project.

This release highlights some very significant changes to anything from the JavaScript libraries being used, to a brand new Media Manager. Although there are no security fixes highlighted, there were various bugs fixed along with the newly added features.

New software is great because it keeps things fresh, it introduces great new features, and removes old and antiquated functionality.
Then there is the other side of the coin. When new code and functionality is released, you’re releasing new potential risks. New releases are also your indicator that things have been fixed, bad code removed. Although that’s good, it means you have to test and update your installations, what a pain, right? Not really! It’s not a huge burden by any means, but it does require a little bit of work on your end to keep updated. Of course this is in general, large sites require a bit more elbow grease.
WordPress has a great update engine built in, and works like a charm in almost every case. So our recommendation to you is to head over to your wp-admin panel, to yourdomain.com/wp-admin/update-core.php specifically, and update.
