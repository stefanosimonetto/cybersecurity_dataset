Avoid this “Casino Online Promotion” 419 Scam
Remember the time when you won a ridiculous amount of money from a Casino you’d never heard of, much less visited?
Me neither, but as it turns out it doesn’t really matter when dealing with the wacky world of email spam – where winnings are often plentiful despite not actually taking part:

Going by the wonderfully informative title of “Re: jqwnfm” (which is designed to make you think “Ooh, I wonder what that is that I’ve replied to…”), the missive reads as follows:

I know what you’re thinking – this sounds like a load of old nonsense. And you’d be right – it IS a load of old nonsense. Should you reply to the above, you’ll likely either by parted with your money via wire transfer (wave goodbye to it forever, you won’t be getting it back) or turned into a money mule which is a sudden deepdive into illegality. At the very least, the scammers will be able to make use of all the personal information you’ve sent them, so that movie line about winning moves and not playing is most definitely the best course of action.
