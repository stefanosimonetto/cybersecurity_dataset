A look into some RIG exploit kit campaigns
In the past few weeks we’ve talked about the Neutrino and Magnitude exploit kits. This time, we take a look at RIG EK and in particular at various distribution channels and payloads.
Like most exploit kits, RIG relies on compromised sites and malvertising as its source of traffic but is one of the less sophisticated EKs due to its use of older exploits. For instance, its Flash exploit (CVE-2015-8651) was patched in late December 2015 whereas other EKs are using a more recent Flash exploit from May 2016 (CVE-2016-4117).

RIG EK exploiting Flash 20.0.0.228 (CVE-2015-8651)
Despite a less potent engine, RIG EK still generates a fair amount of traffic via several malware campaigns. The redirection mechanism from compromised site or malvertising to RIG EK is either done server side (302 redirects) or client side (iframe, JavaScript).
Different malware campaigns may represent different customers of the exploit kit (which can explain the various malware payloads), or the same individual diversifying his operations for redundancy purposes. One surprise with the samples we collected below is the absence of ransomware, a payload that is usually very prevalent with other exploit kits. Instead, we see bots and stealers that are thoroughly packed and obfuscated.
Campaigns overview:

The naming convention here is very basic as we picked some string or pattern that was unique for each campaign and used it as a label to differentiate it from others. As a note, there are probably additional variants, and other gates we have not documented here.
302 redirect

The 302 redirect path, as its name indicates it, uses server side 302 redirection to RIG EK’s landing page. For the most part, these are hacked sites that still load their content and perform the redirect.
Payload:

0289ab23c01b2ccb9f347035b5fca1bf8a607bc511dfbe52df8881c6482a4723
Neurevt Bot (Betabot)
Unpacked: malwr
Neurevt info

gonext

This is one of the most active campaigns easily recognizable by the use of redirectors from certain TLDs, such as .top, and HTML files largely obfuscated with naming patterns such as lobo.phtml. The ultimate redirect to RIG relies on a 302, from a fairly static domain name (i.e. artisticplaces.net).
Payload:

c5184a30a88c234d3031c7661e0383114b54078448d62ae6fb51a4455863d4b5
Dofoil (Smoke Loader)
Unpacked: malwr
Smoke Loader info
C&C: prince-of-persia24.ru
Downloads: payload (IRC bot, C&C: med-global-fox.com)

randphp

This distribution path is also very popular and leverages compromised sites injected with JavaScript that redirects to an intermediary site using a randomly named php file that contains an iframe to RIG EK.
Payload:

1a3e2f940db24ff23c40adfd45d053036bad7372699c904c1ef0aaae81b24c5d
Packed with VB packer, crashes

trk

This campaign is based on malvertising that uses a two level redirection: a spammy/dummy site and a tracker which logs stats via a Google Analytics account and redirects to RIG EK via iframe.
Payload:

09f7926969f1dd11b828e2a3537c923646389140b2dba64c0b623b58099f3b64
Gootkit
Unpacked: malwr

vollumne

This is yet another malvertising based campaign that funnels all traffic via vollumne.com, a domain registered to gianafyn410@yahoo.com (Russia). It uses a simple 302 redirect (server side) mechanism to RIG EK.
Payload:

fe128f8bc1be6a0076dd78133ae69029374e25b2662aaafdeb846af1bc60b617
Packed with VB packer, crashes

Custom redirector

This attack path appears to use hacked or bogus domains stuffed with other content (porn, viagra, other ads). It may also be linked via malvertising and the redirection mechanism to RIG EK happens thanks to an iframe tag injected at the bottom of the home page.
Payload:

bb863da684e0b4a1940f0150a560745b6907c14ff295d93f73e5075adb28f3ea
Backdoor – turns off Windows Security Center
Automated analysis: malwr

IPredir

This is another easily recognizable attack with a custom redirector (i.e. casinoplayerall.online) and a redirect to a hardcoded IP address (i.e. 131.72.136.46) performing the final redirection to RIG EK.
Payload:

f21a7b90a83c482948206060d6637dffafc97ef319c9d7fa82f07cd9e8a7ec56
Gootkit
Unpacked: (intermediate payload) -> dropper_dll_service.dll

IPredirvariant

More recently we started seeing this redirect mechanism. These campaigns are malvertising driven, and lead to a harcoded IP address owned by threat actors.
Payload:

a1985dd74238996ab137b21f1856a5787ce07c8cd09744a260aaf1310d4a8944
Packed with VB packer, crashes

Malshadow

Malvertising based attack path with the use of domain shadowing as the redirector to RIG EK.
Payload:

b91dd7571f191224ea8802bb9c9d153857b4f5d48eb72b811620268e8c954a00
Gootkit
Unpacked: dropper_dll_service.dll

Conclusion
The demise of Nuclear EK and the mysterious disappearance of Angler EK, by far two of the more sophisticated exploit kits to date, has lead to a new playing field where even smaller actors get increased exposure. Neutrino took the first spot and is used for high profile attacks via malvertising and a number of popular gates via hacked sites.
We continue to see RIG EK in malvertising attacks with low quality traffic and the tried and tested hacked sites distribution path, which all in all is very similar to Magnitude EK, except for the latter having an advantage with a better Flash exploit.
Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit customers continue to be protected against the RIG exploit kit.
