“In our digital age, the issues of cybersecurity are no longer just for the technology 
crowd; they matter to us all. Whether you work in business or politics, the military or the 
media—or are simply an ordinary citizen—this is an essential read.”
—Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman, Google
[Word Count: 47]

“This is the most approachable and readable book ever written on the cyber world. The 
authors have distilled the key facts and policy, provided sensible recommendations, and 
opened the debate generally to any informed citizen: a singular achievement. A must read 
for practitioners and scholars alike.”
—Admiral James Stavridis, US Navy (Ret), former NATO Supreme Allied Commander

“Singer and Friedman do a highly credible job of documenting the present and likely 
future risky state of cyber-affairs. This is a clarion call.”

“I loved this book. Wow. Until I read this astonishing and important book, I didn’t know 
how much I didn’t know about the hidden world of cybersecurity and cyberwar.  Singer 
and Friedman make comprehensible an impossibly complex subject, and expose the 
frightening truth of just how vulnerable we are.  Understanding these often-invisible 
threats to our personal and national security is a necessary fi rst step toward defending 
ourselves against them.  This is an essential read.”

describes, cyberspace is becoming “the dominant platform for life 
in the 21st century.”
