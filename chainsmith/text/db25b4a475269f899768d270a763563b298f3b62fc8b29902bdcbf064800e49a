Trojan SMS Found on Google Play
I’m not quite sure how this one slipped under Google Play’s radar, but a SMS Trojan app with the package name com.FREE_APPS_435.android claims to be a download for wallpapers, videos, and music was actively on the Google Play store until November 13, 2014.

The Trojan tricks its victims by requesting permission to send premium SMS messages in exchange for downloaded content.
This tactic has been seen since malware started appearing on Android devices.  If you visit the developer’s website from the link provided on the Google Play page, it takes you to a page with two banners and a couple of links.

The two banners advertise downloadable content.  To receive the content, the user must send a text message to a premium SMS number.  By doing so, the user subscribes to a daily feed at the price of 12 Thai Baht, or 37 cents in USD, per day.
Translations of the two banners:
** FILE ** off and click it .
Type P1 and send to 4872035
Subscribe to daily : 12 baht / SMS / day .
** Video ** backdoor to do
