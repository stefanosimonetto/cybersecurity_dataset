The Steam Wallet is something you can use to place funds in your Steam account, either by adding money directly or redeeming Steam wallet codes. Here’s a site which claims to offer up a Steam Wallet Hack Tool:

If you see sites offering up something-for-nothing programs where Steam is concerned (or anything else for that matter), think long and hard on the old “If it seems too good to be true…” adage.
Methods of extracting freebies from major software publishers are extremely rare, and they definitely do not get placed behind cookie-cutter survey gateways.
We’ve previously looked at sites riding on the coat-tails of the Steam Wallet back in September, and you can bet there’s a lot more URLs out there doing similar things.
There is no magic bullet for free Steam credit, and you should treat any site claiming to have the “solution” with a healthy dose of skepticism.
