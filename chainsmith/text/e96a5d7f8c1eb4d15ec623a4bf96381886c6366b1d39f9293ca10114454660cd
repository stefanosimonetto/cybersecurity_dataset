UTM 9.003 Up2Date Released

We've recently published UTM 9.003 as a two part Up2Date labelled 9.003-15 and 9.003-16. You can see more about this two-part package by reading on for the full details inside. Before that however, a small update that we plan to begin the ASG V8 to UTM V9 one-touch appliance upgrade process on Oct-22nd for the 220/320 appliances. Following a smooth roll out, the next week we will enable the rest of the appliance line, followed by HA/Cluster systems near the middle of November. Now for 9.003 - the reason for this Up2Date is to allow for more Wireless Access Points, some improvements for our Webserver Protection, and support for the hotly-anticipated RED 50 appliance (featuring increased throughput and an innovative dual Internet connection balancer)which is in Beta and will be available soon! Read on for the full details, manual Up2Date information, and links for new ISO images. Enjoy!

Network up2date

We’ve recently published UTM 9.003 as a two part Up2Date labelled 9.003-15 and 9.003-16. You can see more about this two-part package by reading on for the full details inside. Before that however, a small update that we plan to begin the ASG V8 to UTM V9 one-touch appliance upgrade process on Oct-22nd for the 220/320 appliances. Following a smooth roll out, the next week we will enable the rest of the appliance line, followed by HA/Cluster systems near the middle of November.
Now for 9.003 – the reason for this Up2Date is to allow for more Wireless Access Points, some improvements for our Webserver Protection, and support for the hotly-anticipated RED 50 appliance (featuring increased throughput and an innovative dual Internet connection balancer)which is in Beta and will be available soon! Read on for the full details, manual Up2Date information, and links for new ISO images. Enjoy!

The reason for the two-part numbering of 9.003 this time is that there was a small difference between our soft-released version (made available early via the User Forums) and the GA release. UTM 9 added the ability for us to issue incremental version Up2Date packages, and we will now work on how to bundle/hide versions of the same release yet with a different build from your systems. The end result we desire is that if you have 9.002, you would see only 9.003-16 to install. More to come on that in the future.
For today, to quote an agent of our system: “Grab 222 of your closest friends and have an access point party”, as we have increased the number of AP’s which can be connected to UTM from 100 to 223 to aid in larger deployments of our amazing wireless offering. The RED50 has begun a limited Beta period, and we’ll look to have that appliance available in our markets very soon. We are confident you will be impressed with the throughput over the smaller RED10 and the new dual-WAN balancer which provides full bandwidth across both connections, even for a single download. It offers much more than an inferior session-based round-robin approach. We also have new ISO images available. Here are the download details:
