Kaspkersky False Positive in gosearch.gif

Posted by Roger on 2 November 2009, 3:03 pm

Kaspersky is detecting gosearch.gif as Trojan.JS.ramif.a.
gosearch.gif is a standard magnifying glass icon used in Sharepoint as a search button.
I submitted this to Kaspersky and they concur its a false positive, so hopefully updated defs will be out shortly.
