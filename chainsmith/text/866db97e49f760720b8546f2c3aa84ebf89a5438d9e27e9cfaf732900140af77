Tonight, I saw a public service announcement educating viewers about online scams. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has put up a site fakechecks.org. They have fraud tests, videos and prevention advise.
I thought this was a really cool site. Its pretty easy to make fun of the rubes that are losing this money this way. Be a better person than that and educate them so they arenâ€™t taken advantage of by online con men.
