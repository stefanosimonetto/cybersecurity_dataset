Now, if you are also a developer of an anti-virus engine, you ought to have done your duty, learned all these tricks and made sure your emulator won&rsquo;t fall for them. You might then expect that your engine would be able to go through the external layers of protection and get to the heart of the malicious code without any difficulty. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth &ndash; the real fun is just beginning.</p><p>The authors of the high-profile malware families are also aware of our industry&rsquo;s research efforts and the countermeasures introduced by our engine developers. They are also pretty much aware of the capabilities of AV emulators, and are ready and prepared to deploy tricks to overcome them.</p><p>In this article I will analyse only a minuscule cross-section of the threat landscape, both in time and in terms of malware family representation. Only three malware families will be described, and only a few months will be covered for each. This is hardly a complete picture, but it will give an idea of how much pressure the bad guys put on AV developers, and the level of the arms race that engine developers have to face on the battlefield. I am certain that even within this limited scope, several different variants will have gone unnoticed by us (as we mainly observe those that our scanner didn&rsquo;t detect), so the difficulties outlined in this article should be considered to be significantly underestimated. Even with all these limitations, the length of this article well exceeds that of a usual <span class="emphasis"><em>Virus Bulletin</em></span> article &ndash; which gives an indication of the full weight of the problems we are facing every day.</p><p>All three malware families are active today. When selecting the particular observation periods I picked a time range when we could pretty confidently identify and follow the regular development within the family.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3995928"></a>Already the Greeks &hellip;</h2></div></div></div><p>Systematic attempts to fool emulators are nothing new. They date back at least five years, to the mass appearance of Tibs variants. The earlier ones only used FPU instructions at the entry point. The FPU infrastructure and instruction set was omitted by AV emulators in order to save development effort and memory space, thus successful emulation was rendered impossible within a few instructions.</p><p>Several variants used fake API calls with invalid arguments just to check that the appropriate error condition was returned. These API calls included all sorts of non-core system dlls from gdi32 to wsock32, such as: AbortDoc, BeginDeferWindowPos, CIsinh, closesocket, CombineRgn, DdeUnaccessData, DeleteUrlCacheContainer, DragQueryFile, EndDialog, EndPath, ExtractAssociatedIcon, GetTapePosition, GetTimeFormat, InternetErrorDlg, InvertRgn, PropertySheet, RealizePalette, ShFileOperation, StartPage and WantArrows. These variants started appearing at the end of 2006 and we have seen the occasional sample as late as 2008.</p><p>Later on, numerous variants of Swizzor (mostly active from 2008&ndash;2009) became proficient at squeezing so many fake loops into the top layers that going through them took tens of millions of CPU instructions, easily exhausting emulators&rsquo; limitations. Due to performance issues, emulators in scan engines are not allowed to run indefinitely (as that would slow down the system &ndash; which users generally don&rsquo;t tolerate well).</p><p>These and several other families would be well worth a detailed analysis, but instead I will focus on more recent developments.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4320105"></a>Backdoor.Cycbot</h2></div></div></div><p>The observation period for these samples spanned only one month, between 11 April 2011 and 11 May 2011. However, I should note that newer variants following the same structure and using the same tricks have continued to appear on a regular basis ever since.</p><p>This one is really nasty; the top layer defence uses callback functions and undocumented tricks. It is very clear that the authors of this family were actively looking for (obviously) undocumented leftovers in CPU registers after <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span> API calls. These functions use the stdcall calling convention, in which registers EAX, ECX and EDX are designated for use within the function. EAX is used for the return value; the state of the ECX and EDX registers is supposed to be undefined, not to be relied on. However, after some extensive research work, the authors of Cycbot found several cases where the values of ECX and EDX are defined, and they relied on this fact to distinguish real <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span> systems from incompletely emulated ones.</p><p>The general structure of the top-level obfuscation layer can be divided into four distinct stages, as illustrated in <a href="#figure.1">Figure 1</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="figure.1"></a><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="The general structure of the top-level obfuscation layer can be divided into four stages." src="/uploads/images/figures/2011/10/Szapi-1.jpg" /></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The general structure of the top-level obfuscation layer can be divided into four stages.</b></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3392802"></a>Stage 1</h3></div></div></div><p>The first stage features an appropriately selected API call (in our example FindFirstVolume), and both EAX and ECX register values are used in the subsequent calculation. EAX is clear: it should hold the return value from the function. But ECX is not supposed to contain anything specific.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that, upon return, ECX points to an address in kernel32 where a C2 (RET) instruction is located. The malware code checks the presence of this byte at the memory location pointed to by ECX.</p><p>How on earth does ECX get to point to an address with this very special location and content? It turns out that the commonly used exception handler unwind procedure in the kernel does not clean up the ECX register. The kernel code is the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">.text:7C869F9C E8 6A 85 F9 FF       call    SEH_unwind
.text:7C869FA1 C2 08 00             retn 8
...
.text:7C80250B         SEH_unwind   proc near
.text:7C80250B 8B 4D F0             mov ecx, [ebp-10h]
.text:7C80250E 64 89 0D 00 00 00 00 mov   large fs:0, ecx
.text:7C802515 59                   pop   ecx
.text:7C802516 5F                   pop   edi

.text:7C80251B C3                   retn
.text:7C80251B         SEH_unwind   endp
</pre><p>Here, the exit point from the procedure is 7C869FA1. This is pushed onto the stack during the call preceding the unwind, where it is popped into ECX and used in a push/ret combination to return to the exit point. However, ECX is not restored to the original value there, as it was not originally saved at the beginning of the FindFirstVolume call. So the ECX register will contain the address of the 7C869FA1 exit point from the kernel procedure when returning to the user code.</p><p>In this particular example, due to the invalid buffer address passed, the FindFirstVolume call returns with the INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE error code in EAX, and this value is also multiplied by the expected dword at ECX to determine the condition to continue (but only the lowest byte is used in the evaluation as, depending on the function, the return code set after the C2 byte may differ).</p><p>It is pretty obvious that for this kind of arithmetic calculation any API function that returns -1 as an error code on an invalid argument, and which leaves the exit point address in ECX on return, would be sufficient. And indeed, the malware authors must have done their homework &ndash; within the observation period the following API functions filled this role: FindFirstVolumeA, lstrcpynW, PrivMoveFileIdentityW, DosPathToSessionPathW, QueryDosDeviceW, ReplaceFileW, WaitForMultipleObjectsEx, WaitForMultipleObjects and WaitNamedPipeA (and I am sure this is not the full list).</p><p>In a slightly different scheme other APIs were used, namely lstrcpyA and FillConsoleOutputCharacterA. In these cases, only the on-error zero return value is checked.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4114190"></a>Stage 2</h3></div></div></div><p>The core element of the second stage is another API call. From tracing the code it turns out that, upon return, the malware expects 0x07 in the EDX register and uses this in calculating the exact address of the callback function needed in the third stage. This was at first a great surprise for me, as EDX is not supposed to contain anything on return (except when returning 64-bit values, which is clearly not the case here). How does the magic value appear in this register? To find out, we need to go into the depths of the kernel code.</p><p>A process handle (usually 3, but in one case 1) is passed over to an API call, in our case GetProcessId. This leads to ZwQueryInformationProcess which (since such low process ID numbers are not used on a running <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span> system) results in error code STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE (0xC0000008). This status code is passed further to ntdll: RtlNtStatusToDosError, which is supposed to convert this value to an error code using an ordered table of error code mappings. This is an incomplete table and does not contain all of the possible codes, rather a range of status codes is mapped to the same error code, and the table contains the starting point and length of each range. The compare stops when a value is found that is higher than the looked up code.</p><p>In the neighbourhood of the specific error code there are only two codes: STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL (0xC0000001) and STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC000000D). The table also contains a delta value &ndash; it is my guess that this represents the length of the interval that maps the error code in the table. If this is the case, it would mean that error codes from 0xC0000001 to 0xC0000001<span class="emphasis"><em>+delta</em></span> are mapped to the same system error code. During the process the distance of the queried error code from the lower neighbour in the table is calculated in the EDX register &ndash; in this case it will be 0xC0000008-0xC0000001=7. This value is then compared to the delta length of the interval, and if it is smaller, the correct mapping is found. But this is not important for the malware, the important part is the fact that the EDX register is not cleaned by either of the kernel functions, remaining there when the code returns to user mode, and it is used by the malware in the line:</p><pre class="programlisting">.text:00402F06 3B 04 2A  cmp eax, [edx+ebp]</pre><p>EAX should contain NULL after an invalid passed handle; EBP points to the top of the stack. [edx+ebp] points to the highest byte of the dword at the original stack (on reaching the entry point) &ndash; which is the return address to kernel32, pushed there when starting the process in CreateRemoteThread. This highest byte of the kernel return address is not supposed to be 0, which is the condition that the malware expects to find.</p><p>Obviously, for this phase any other function that returns with STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE, calls RtlNtStatusToDosError and does not restore EDX to its original state, would be sufficient. It turns out that the malware authors limited their scope to functions that call NtQueryInformationProcess with an invalid process ID, after which a call RtlNtStatusToDosError follows. The result is the following observed list of used functions: GetProcessId, CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent, GetProcessHandleCount, GetProcessAffinityMask, GetProcessWorkingSetSize and GetPriorityClass.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3229757"></a>Stage 3</h3></div></div></div><p>This stage was stable in the observation period; no changes were observed. The offset at which to continue execution is calculated in EAX (once there, the value of EDX, already used in Stage 2, is used again), and it is passed as the callback address to the function EnumResourceTypesA, which calls this callback function internally at some point. The possible reason why this part never changed could be that it is difficult to find a <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span> API call that calls a user-mode callback even if the passed parameters are invalid.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3353306"></a>Stage 4</h3></div></div></div><p>Stage 4 is fairly simple, building up in EAX the address of the next (herein not discussed) stage, which features spaghetti code.</p><p>Stage 4 is reached as the result of the callback invocation from within EnumResourceTypesA, as discussed in the previous section.</p><p>At offset 00402F3A in our example the malware code overwrites the return address from EnumResourceTypesA on the stack, knowing the exact amount of stack space used by the API function at the point when the callback was invoked. Thus, upon finishing the EnumResourceTypesA call, the execution will not resume at address 00402F1F as would normally happen without this change, but due to the modified return address on the stack, the spaghetti code will be reached.</p><p>Emulating this stage correctly is a real challenge, as the emulator should produce exactly the same stack layout and allocation as the original API function, and invoke the callback providing the same conditions.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4342625"></a>Trojan.Codecpack.Gen!Pac</h2></div></div></div><p>In this family the analysed anti-emulation code is not around the entry point, but some time later in the execution flow. The entry code features numerous different and repetitive do-nothing API calls, with no expected effect and no expected return values. That should not pose a problem for any decent emulator.</p><p>What will be a problem is the following code, taken from one of the variants:</p><pre class="programlisting">.text:00406A9D 68 68 53 40 00      push  offset LibFileName ; &ldquo;version.dll&rdquo;

</pre><p>The trojan loads a standard system library using either LoadLibrary or GetModuleHandle. This call should return a handle, which is eventually the base load address of the dll file. The memory image of the system library is then scanned, looking for an identification dword. In the case of Win32 emulators, it is often (if not always) the case that only a small subset of exported functions are actually implemented &ndash; the rest are only empty dummy procedures. Thus the code bytes that are present in the real system dlls will not be present in the emulated libraries. In this case, the malware will search through the allocated memory space of the emulator dll (which should result in an exception when reaching the end of the allocated memory block), and aborts the execution.</p><p>How do the malware authors know which dwords will not be in the emulator dlls? They may have determined this either by a trial-and-error method, using their own multi-scanner systems, or by dumping the targeted scanner&rsquo;s memory image, and finding the emulated dlls within the dump. Both options are viable.</p><p>During the observation period between 8 March 2010 and 17 June 2010 five dlls were used for this purpose. Shell32.dll was used on 24 occasions, and there were 19, 14 and nine occurrences respectively of shlwapi.dll, gdi32.dll and version.dll. In an early variant, a single appearance of msvcp60.dll was observed, but this was abandoned later. Within these dlls 55 different byte patterns were searched, some of which were used in the context of multiple libraries, thus resulting in 67 different combinations. These are summarized in the table shown in <a href="#figure.2">Figure 2</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="figure.2"></a><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Dwords looked up in system libraries." src="/uploads/images/figures/2011/10/Szapi-table1.jpg" /></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Dwords looked up in system libraries.</b></p></div><p>Altogether, a new combination was released approximately every other day. If you want to beef up your emulator to follow this workload, you must be able to release new emulator updates within a day. Otherwise, by the time an update is added to handle the latest trick it will be obsolete as the malware authors have already switched to a new one. The development effort required to overcome these tricks is trivial, simply consisting of adding the look-up dwords into the emulator dlls, and even the location of these bytes is not important. The real issues are the necessary QA procedures around releasing emulator updates, which make the task close to impossible.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2591941"></a>Trojan.Winwebsec.Gen</h2></div></div></div><p>This is a very widespread and populated family, with plenty of slightly or very different variants.

In short, a full &ndash; more precisely realistic &ndash; Win32 emulation is needed. If you are in the lucky position of already having that, you don&rsquo;t need to read further than this point.</p><p>But it is not enough to do it right, you also have to do it fast.</p><p>The table below summarizes the mean time between the significant changes in each family. In this context &lsquo;significant&rsquo; means something that is likely to require a change in the emulation, and that we were able to observe in the appearance of the new variant. As mentioned, it is certain that I have missed several variants in each family. Therefore the average time between the appearance of variants is overestimated &ndash; in reality they should appear somewhat more frequently. Nevertheless, even these overestimated numbers look scary enough. For me, at least.</p><div class="table"><a class="chapter" id="id3198226"></a><table border="1" summary="Average update times in the three families."><colgroup><col align="center" /><col /><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left"><span class="bold"><strong>Family</strong></span></td><td><span class="bold"><strong>Mean time between variants (days)</strong></span></td><td><span class="bold"><strong>Variants</strong></span></td><td><span class="bold"><strong>First variant</strong></span></td><td><span class="bold"><strong>Last variant</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Backdoor.Cycbot</td><td>2.31</td><td>13</td><td>11/04/2011</td><td>11/05/2011</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Trojan.Codecpack.Gen!Pac</td><td>1.64</td><td>77</td><td>12/03/2010</td><td>16/07/2010</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Trojan.Winwebsec.Gen</td><td>3.25</td><td>32</td><td>30/12/2010</td><td>13/04/2011</td></tr></tbody></table><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Average update times in the three families.</b></p></div><p>Overall, it seems like this is a lost battle. But not necessarily. In fact, there are a couple of solutions &ndash; though full of pain. I am afraid there is no easy way, but after a few years fighting viruses, one gets used to that.</p><p>Let us assume for the sake of argument that our purpose, as bizarre as it sounds, is to provide proactive defence against new malware threats.</p><p>If your research-development-QA-release cycle regarding emulator enhancement for issues detailed in previous sections (which are essentially minor changes from a development point of view) is shorter than a day, then the situation is not hopeless. Then you would end up covering about half of the distribution campaign of the given variants, still providing measurable proactive protection for the second half of the campaign. Achieving such a short cycle is far from easy. Depending on the nature of your emulator-based detection definitions, changes in the emulation environment may occasionally change the execution flow of executables, thus unexpectedly breaking totally unrelated definitions. Another disadvantage is that the first day or so of the distribution campaign has to be handled with one of the traditional reactive methods.</p><p>If the development cycle time is longer than a couple of days, you need a different approach. One can use the actual <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span> environment with a behaviour blocking technology which, since it utilizes the real <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span> environment, is fully compatible (if the user has the environment that the malware expects). But even then this solution is not a pre-execution defence, as the malware has to be executed.</p><p>Another possible solution is to use the real <span class="emphasis"><em>Windows</em></span> environment in a sandbox to extend the emulator with the missing features. Careful design and implementation is required in order to contain the malware within the safe boundaries.</p><p>I know that pattern matching is a dead technology (see [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.16">16</a></span>]). It has been for 20 years. But in some cases, it can be handy. Ironically, in this particular case it produces longer lasting definitions than emulator tweaking, since the basic structure of all three families&rsquo; code is pretty much constant, only the particular API functions are changed. In fact, this was the reason why several different members of these families went unnoticed by us: our definitions caught them, and because we have so much to do, we mostly look at samples that we don&rsquo;t detect. This does not mean that our definitions did not have to be changed. They did, many times. But not as frequently as the new emulator tricks appeared.</p><p>Overall, we can state that the most profiled malware families of the day push AV engines to their limits, and sometimes even a little over them. We can&rsquo;t stop for a moment. But this is our job. Not everyone can be a rocket scientist.</p><div class="bibliography"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2321171"></a>Bibliography</h3></div></div></div><div class="bibliomixed"><a id="citation.1"></a><p class="bibliomixed">[1] <span class="bibliosource"><a href="http://pferrie.tripod.com/papers/unpackers.pdf" target="_blank">Ferrie, P.
