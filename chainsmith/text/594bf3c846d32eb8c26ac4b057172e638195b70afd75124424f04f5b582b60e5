HR Recruiting should step it up to obtain top infosec talent

With infosec unemployment approaching 0%, particularly in the DC are where I live, companies need to be competitive in their recruitment. Â Jeff Snyder of SecurityRecruiter.com posts an interesting articleÂ on this.
I changed jobs in 2014 andÂ a lot of this rings true to me.
Obviously improvements in salary, telecommuting, vacation, good retirement matching and good retirement program would be a nice start. Â  But this is about the hiring process not fantasy. ðŸ˜‰
There are reasons why so many jobs go to people with connections. Itâ€™s not necessarily because networking is so awesome.
Is the job posting interesting? When you are networking, your contact can tell you whatâ€™s great about the job. Â If youâ€™re coming in cold, what about that posting sets it apart? Â While Iâ€™ve seen examples that go too far in the other direction, generally going too far isnâ€™t the problem. Â  Most are boiler plate for 50% of the content.
Is recruiting treating the resumes like an auditor running down a checklist? Â  Most job seekers believe this is the case. Â They add in buzzwords to the rÃ©sumÃ© thinking they will score higher on relevance. Â  If the HR recruiter is looking for 3 years of X and 2 years of Y, they may miss out on a great candidate. Â The best resume may never make it past the gatekeeper to the hiring manager. Â  Another point for networking. Â It gets the rÃ©sumÃ© into the hiring managerâ€™s hands.
According to Jeff, companies are still taking too long in making decisions. Â  With the short bench, talent has lots of choices. Â  If youâ€™re planning to hire the people you attract to a job req, you should be ready to move.
