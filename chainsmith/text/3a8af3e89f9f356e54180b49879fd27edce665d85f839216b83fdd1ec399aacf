Got to love the constant reboot.

This in from the SANS ISC

McAfee released information as well: W32/IRCbot.worm
This is an IRC bot worm, and will scan for TCP port 445, and for file shares. McAfee reports in it’s bulletin that systems not patched for MS05-039 will continually reboot. (emphesis added)
Actually they may do us a favor. If a tree falls in the woods and no one hears it does anyone care? To put it another way, if a system gets infected with zotob and no one knows it does anyone care? You can probably ignore zotob, just as people are ignorant of their botnet infections. You cannot however ignore your computer constantly rebooting. You’ll scream to high heaven about that. That will result it you being able to clean, and having more leverage in patching (though it is already too late for that).
