Phony My Team Voice App Being Spread on Steam Chat
We have come to know of a new Steam scam making rounds within the gaming community via a submission by one of our users in the Malwarebytes Forums.
He/She reported of a piece of malicious software being spread around by scammers via the Steam platform’s chat feature. Recipients of the message are pointed to the URL, myteamvoxing[DOT]com/en/home/index, where they are encouraged to download and install a supposed voice application that can be used in-game. Below is a screenshot of the site:

In case you, dear Reader, are not familiar with the look of the above site, it’s almost resembles My Team Voice [https://myteamvoice.com], a legitimate domain where gamers can download and install a voice chat tool. Such a tool is usually needed for MMORPG so team members can speak to each other, if the game or the gaming platform itself does not provide voice chat by default.
Although myteamvoxing has been categorized as a phishing domain, we believe this is not the case as the domain in question does not provide site visitors the option to login or register for an account. It merely acted as a location where one can easily download myteamvoxing.exe, which is of course malware.
Malwarebytes Anti-Malware already protects users from the fake website and malicious file. We detect it as Trojan.Inject.
One user who was able to download and install the fake program claimed that his Steam account was hijacked, and that he had to change his password and finally run AV program. If you have executed the scam file, we suggest you do the same.
