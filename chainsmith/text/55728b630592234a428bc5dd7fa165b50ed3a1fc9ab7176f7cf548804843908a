Will Google blacklist itself?

We were analyzing an infected site today and their Google blacklist diagnostic said the following:

Has this site hosted malware?

Yes, this site has hosted malicious software over the past 90 days. It infected 3 domain(s), including site.com/, google.com/.

Humâ€¦ So Google.com was somehow infected as well? I know it is probably some small sub site from within Google, but I found it interesting that they listed Googleâ€™s main domain in there.
If you look at Googleâ€™s own diagnostic page, it says:

31 page(s) resulted in malicious software being downloaded and installed without user consent. The last time Google visited this site was on 2011-03-28, and the last time suspicious content was found on this site was on 2011-03-28.

Has this site acted as an intermediary resulting in further distribution of malware?

Over the past 90 days, google.com appeared to function as an intermediary for the infection of 71 site(s) including our-pretty-pets.blogspot.com/, daum.net/, portovelhodownload.blogspot.com/.

Has this site hosted malware?
Yes, this site has hosted malicious software over the past 90 days. It infected 72 domain(s), including tamansoftware.co.cc/, agusnih.co.cc/, duniamisteri.co.cc/.

Letâ€™s see if Google actually blacklists themselves ðŸ™‚
