Over the past week, cybercriminals have been spamvertising millions of emails impersonating Amazon.com in an attempt to trick customers into thinking that they’ve received a Shipping Confirmation for a Vizio XVT3D04, HD 40-Inch 720p 100 Hz Cinema 3D LED-LCD HDTV FullHD and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses.
Once users click on any of the links found in the malicious email, they’re automatically exposed to the client-side exploits served by the latest version of the Black Hole Exploit kit.
