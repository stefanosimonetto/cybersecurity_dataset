Labs Notes Monthly Recap â€“ Apr/2017

This month, our Malware Research and Incident Response teams wrote about several malware techniques that attempt to evade detection by focusing on small changes that website owners might miss. Examples include typos in domain names, unused top-level domains (i.e. .com, .solutions), and delayed banner ads.
Sucuri Labs provides website malware research updates directly from our teams on the front line. You can read past-monthly recaps to catch up on trends we look at every month.
