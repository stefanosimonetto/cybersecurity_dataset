Network up2date

Hi all,
here comes the second Beta of Astaro Security Linux 4.0 (first announcement is here)! Version number is 3.380 – you see we make big steps to the final ASL 4.000. Let me place again an emphasis on the nature of a Beta – although most things should work properly please do not use it in a production environment.
Thx a lot for your feedback and bug reports!

In addition to a lot of small fixes and improvements, we completed the online help, and fixed the following issues from the first beta:

Radius for Surf Protection is now working properly
HA Up2Date is now working properly

We plan to release a additional BETA/RC within the next few weeks, still some work to do:

WLAN only station mode, access point not working yet
AMD K6/Intel PentiumI CPUs not working
configuration problems in Port Scan Detection

Backup File from 3.318 or 3.2XX should work, but note: if you install a backup from 3.318 or 3.2XX and want enable "Surf Protection" please apply the following command on a root console before install the backup:
code:

cp /etc/wfe/conf/selfmonitoring-default /etc/wfe/conf/selfmonitoring-default_3.380

and this line after the backup install:

code:

cp /etc/wfe/conf/selfmonitoring-default_3.380 /etc/wfe/conf/selfmonitoring-default;touch /etc/no-superdaemon/suicide

We will be happy to provide you a Up2Date for this BETA within next days.
