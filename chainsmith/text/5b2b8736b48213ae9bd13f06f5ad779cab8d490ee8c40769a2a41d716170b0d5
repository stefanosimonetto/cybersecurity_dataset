Webroot, the market leader in cloud-based, real-time Internet threat detection, recently returned from the 18th annual Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3 for short, hosted by the Entertainment Software Association.  Used by many of the video game manufacturers across the various platforms, as well as hardware and software developers, the trade show is used to show off the next generation of games-related products.  Hosted at the Los Angeles Convention Center, the 2014 conference had over 50,000 reported attendees between June 9th and 12th, 2014.
With this being Webroot’s first appearance at E3, the company was on site to show off Webroot’s new gaming specific antivirus, SecureAnywhere™ AntiVirus for PC Gamers.  Designed to keep users protected with maximum performance and protection, the newest protection offering for consumers garnered a large amount of interest from those in attendance, with a busy booth all day.  From the gamers themselves to the industry experts, many were impressed with the performance, speed, and direct gaming focus that Webroot was providing with the gamer protection product.
Along with the booth presence, Webroot’s team hosted an online campaign to drive awareness of the products with the #CyborgSelfie giveaway, a contest where entrants had to submit a selfie of themselves with the specific Twitter hashtag in hopes of winning a custom built Origin PC protected by Webroot.  With over 40,000 entries, the winner, Johnny Interiano, was drawn at random, and will soon have one of the most powerful Origin PC machines at their disposal for their next gaming conquests.  And to not pass an opportunity to work with Webroot’s newest partner Plantronics, twelve runner-up winners from the same contest won Plantronics RIG gaming headsets.
Through a strong awareness campaign and booth presence, all backed by an innovative security product designed specifically for gamers, Webroot’s presence at E3 was a major success for all that were involved.
