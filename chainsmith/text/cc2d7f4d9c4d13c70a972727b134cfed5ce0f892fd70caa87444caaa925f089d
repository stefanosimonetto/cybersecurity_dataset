I am proud to announce the availability of Astaro Command Center 3.0. ACC is our central management application that you use to see and work with all Astaro products through a single GUI. Simplify your management of Astaro Installations by sharing objects, centrally configuring security policies, and pushing out rules to one or many devices. Whether you have two installations or hundreds, ACC gives you the ability to manage and work with your sites. Best of all, this exciting new version remains completely free -no gimmicks, no asterisks, no hidden conditions. Enjoy!

**Important Licensing Note**: Version 3 now uses our the newer-style licensing model we released in 2010 for our ASG products. This means your existing ACC key  from the MyAstaro portal is longer valid, nor is any outstanding static  keys from the time when we only offered a single key for all  installations. To get your new ACC 3.0 key, fill out the creation form on our website. Your personalized license will then be available via the License Management section of your MyAstaro account.
ACC Version 3.0 is now running on the same technology platform that powers Version 8 of our flagship Astaro Security Gateway product. This gives us a new, capable base with which to advance ACC with even more functionality for the future. Sporting a massively-upgraded GUI experience, ACC 3.0 now offers on-demand reporting, central backup file management, and support for notifications to alert you during desired events.
1) On Demand (Forensic) Reporting – the reporting section can now be  used to run aggregated report queries "as needed" across some/all  installations for a desired timeframe. A change from our existing  aggregated reporting (which compiles almost instantly but has history  and detail limitations), the new ODR can be used to run more detailed queries. This will take a few moments to generate (depending on the amount of installations selected  and the time period you require) as the information is fetched and compiled.
2) Central Backup Management – you can now save and work with backup  files in ACC, providing not only a safe repository to store your  backups, but letting you restore and make backups without logging into  WebAdmin. Combined with the new capabilities of ASG 8.200 to remove  installation-specific data from backups, admins can easily work with a  cookie-cutter type backup which significantly eases implementation of  new ASG’s which have a shared "base" configuration.
3) Notifications – ACC also now supports notifications, alerting configured administrators of many possible events.
