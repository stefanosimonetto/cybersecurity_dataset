I've previously posted about running Debian on my October 1994-era 90 MHz Pentium Quantex QP5/90 PM-3 with 80 MB RAM.  I hadn't booted the box since June 2004.  Today while reading a book on Debian I decided to try upgrading to Debian stable, also known as sarge or 3.1 at the moment.  When I started the process, this was my uname output:Linux oates 2.4.18-1-386 #1 Wed Apr 14 17:34:59 UTC 2004 i586 GNU/LinuxThis is all I had to do:cat /etc/apt/sources.listdeb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian sarge main non-free contribdeb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US sarge/non-US main contrib non-free# apt-get update# apt-get --show-upgraded upgradeBuilding Dependency Tree...

I was prompted to answer a few questions along the way, but accepting the defaults in each case was sufficient.  The process only took a few hours.  I am very impressed.  Debian seems like an excellent choice for ancient hardware.
