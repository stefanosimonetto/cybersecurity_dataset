August 30, 2019 in Anti-Forensics, Living off the land, LOLBins, Reusigned Binaries

This is not really a proper LOLBIN category, but is interesting for many reasons. How often do we see libraries that are written by A, sometimes even open source, but then they are signed by B?
I mentioned 7z a while ago, but there is more…
Examples:

What are the benefits of using these?
They are signedThey are often not up to date –> vulnerableTheir sigs are probably quite hard to be revokedThey are whitelisted by hash by many security solutions, including forensic suites, AV, EDR, etc.
