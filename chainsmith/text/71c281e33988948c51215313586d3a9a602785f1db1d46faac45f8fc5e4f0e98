Angler EK Drops TeslaCrypt Via Recent Flash Exploit
On December 18, security company Fortinet blogged about a possible new variant of the CryptoWall ransomware distributed via spam. Around the same time we discovered that the Angler exploit kit was also pushing this new ‘variant’. However it is not CryptoWall (thanks Yonathan Klijnsma for the tip) but rather TeslaCrypt.

Angler EK uses a very recently patched flaw in Adobe Flash Player up to version 19.0.0.245 (CVE-2015-8446), making it the most lethal exploit kit at the moment.

Ransomware is one of the most prolific and devastating pieces of malware users have had to deal with in recent years.

Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit blocks this particular attack via Angler while Malwarebytes Anti-Malware detects the malware binary (VT 2/55).
