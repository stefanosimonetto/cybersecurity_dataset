Newsflash, the cybercriminals behind the recently profiled malicious campaign impersonating Bank of America, launched yet another massive spam campaign, this time targeting ADP customers. Upon clicking on the link found in the malicious email, users are exposed to the client-side exploits served by the latest version of the Black Hole Exploit Kit.
More details:

Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

Compromised malicious URLs spamvertised in the campaign: hxxp://shawnsheritagemasonry.com/trnztadp.html; hxxp://diversified.usereasy.net/trnztadp.html; hxxp://widespace.com.cn/trnztadp.html; hxxp://www.theironingbasket.com/trnztadp.html; hxxp://runtheattack.com/trnztadp.html; hxxp://kbc-tervuren.be/trnztadp.html; hxxp://egowy.com/loginadptr.html
Client-side exploits serving URL: hxxp://reasonedblitzing.net/detects/lorrys_implication.php – 195.198.124.60, AS3301 – Email: monteene_forbrich8029@mauritius.com; hxxp://nfcmpaa.info/detects/burying_releases-degree.php – 195.198.124.60, AS3301 – Email: nevein_standrin35@kube93mail.com

Responding to the same IP are also the following malicious domains:
win8ss.com – Email: fermetnolega@hotmail.com
legacywins.com – Email: fermetnolega@hotmail.com
openpolygons.net – Email: cordey_yabe139@flashmail.net
steamedboasting.info – Email: mauro_borozny655@medical.net.au
Name servers part of the campaign’s infrastructure:
Name Server: NS1.TOPPAUDIO.COM
Name Server: NS2.TOPPAUDIO.COM
We’ve already seen the same name servers used in the recently profiled “BofA ‘Online Banking Passcode Reset’ themed emails serve client-side exploits and malware” malicious campaign. Clearly, the cybercriminal or gang of cybercriminals behind the campaign continue rotating the impersonated brands, next to using the same malicious infrastructure to achieve their objectives.
