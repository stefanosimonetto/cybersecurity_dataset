Cybercriminals are currently spamvertising millions of emails impersonating PayPal, in an attempt to trick PayPal users into executing the malicious attachment found in the emails.
Using ‘Notification of payment received‘ subjects, the campaign is relying on the end user’s gullibility in an attempt to infect them with malware. Once executed, it grants a malicious attacker complete control over the victim’s PC.
