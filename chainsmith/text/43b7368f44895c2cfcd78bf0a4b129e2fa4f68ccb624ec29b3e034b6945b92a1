Limitations
With the provided ISO image there are maybe some limitations (remember: its a BETA :-) Please check the Known Issue List (http://docs.astaro.org) before you test ASL V6 BETA!
Astaro does not recommend to use ASL V6 BETA in productive environments. There is no manual for ASL V6 BETA and the Online Help may still contain some gaps.
It is possible to import configuration backup files from ASL V5.2X and in the end we will support a config import from ASL V6 BETA into the GA version. We will provide Up2Date packages as well as ISO images for ASL V6 BETA. Please update your test installation regularly. The ASL V6 BETA includes a test license with unlimited users and all features activated. There is no need to request a new or special license.
A hardware compatibility list and a Known Issues List for the BETA release are available at: http://docs.astaro.org
Hardware requirements
Astaro minimum recommendation for V6 BETA installations:

Intel Pentium III 900 MHz
256MB RAM
9 GB hard disk drive and above.

Best performance results running on:

Dual Xeon or Athlon
512MB/1GB RAM
36 GB SCSI 15krpm hard disk drive and above.

For testing purpose you can also use a VMware Workstation (http://www.vmware.com/products/desktop/ws_features.html).
