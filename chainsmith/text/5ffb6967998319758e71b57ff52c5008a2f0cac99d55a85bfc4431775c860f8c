Possible False Positive

In my email, I’m seeing email detected as malware.ae. It looks like the messages are heavy on the html content. But from the subject, source IP, and email addresses involved it does appear to be a false positive.
I’ve opened a support case with Message Labs and sent them a few samples to find out more.
