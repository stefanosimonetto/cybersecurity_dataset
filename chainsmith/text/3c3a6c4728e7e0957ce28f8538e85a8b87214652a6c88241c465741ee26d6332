ESET assess the differences between CryptoFortress and TorrentLocker: two very different strains of ransomware.

Last week, Kafeine published a blog post about a ransomware being distributed by the Nuclear Pack exploit kit. This ransomware identify itself as “CryptoFortress”, but the ransom message and payment page both looks like an already known ransomware: TorrentLocker.

After further analysis, ESET researchers found out is the two threats are in fact very different. It appears the group behind CryptoFortress has stolen the HTML templates with its CSS. The malware code and the scheme are actually very different. Here is a table summering the similarities and differences:

TorrentLocker
CryptoFortress

Propagation
Spam
Exploit kit

File encryption
AES-256 CBC
AES-256 ECB

Hardcoded C&C server
Yes
No

Ransom page location
Fetched from C&C server
Included in malware

Payment page location
Onion-routed (but same server as the hardcoded C&C)
Onion-routed

AES key encryption
RSA-1024
RSA-1024

Cryptographic library
LibTomCrypt
Microsoft CryptoAPI

Encrypted portion of files
2 Mb at beginning of file
First 50% of the file, up to 5 Mb

Payment
Bitcoin (variable amount)
1.0 Bitcoin

CryptoFortress ransom page

TorrentLocker ransom page

Differences in the HTML pages

Last Friday, Renaud Tabary from Lexsi published a complete analysis of the new ransomware. ESET researchers have independently analyzed the CryptoFortress samples before Lexsi released the details. The technical details described in the article matches our findings.

ESET Telemetry also shows TorrentLocker campaign is still propagating via spam messages. Both campaign are now running in parallel.
