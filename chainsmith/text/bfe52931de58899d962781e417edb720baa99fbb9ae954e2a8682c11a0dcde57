Up2Date 7.504 Released

Today we release the 7.504 Up2Date for our Astaro Security Gateway product. This version has a few new features, and adds WebAdmin support for our new product RED. RED (Remote Ethernet Device) acts as a long Ethernet cable to a branch office, requiring no configuration or management. It just "brings" the small remote site directly into the connected ASG as an Interface, which is a totally new way of working with remote locations.

Network up2date

Today we release the 7.504 Up2Date for our Astaro Security Gateway product. This version has a few new features, and adds WebAdmin support for our new product RED. RED (Remote Ethernet Device) acts as a long Ethernet cable to a branch office, requiring no configuration or management. It just "brings" the small remote site directly into the connected ASG as an Interface, which is a totally new way of working with remote locations.

RED is in limited BETA now and will be available soon for all to purchase. You can find out more about Astaro RED here.
More 7.504 details are available by reading on…
This release has a few new features, such as the ability to totally remove (de-proxy) sites from the HTTPS filter using new functionality for exceptions (thus passing them out the packet filter). You can now make exceptions for Web by Category! This is quite powerful when used in combination with the new HTTPS exceptions ability above, such as for not HTTPS inspecting for privacy reasons any sites categorized as Financial/Banking.  Also new are the support for hosting of a Proxy PAC file, and another for privacy – the ability to remove some HTTP events completely from logging (and subsequently reporting). Rounding out the new things are an Uplink monitor/action feature and wildcard SMTP routing support. There are also dozens of bugfixes, tweaks, and stability changes.
