Downforeveryoneorjustme is down

The service http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/ has been down for at least a few hours already. I got the first notification via sucuri.net a few hours ago saying that the page has been changed:
Content changed:> Index of />>    * cgi-bin/>> Apache/2.2.13 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.13 OpenSSL/0.9.7a mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 > mod_bwlimited/1.4 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635 PHP/5.2.11 Server at downforeveryoneorjustme.com Port 80
After that, another alert saying that the page was offline and that their name server was not responding:
Site offline: http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.comdownforeveryoneorjustme.com: no DNS servers could be reached
What I found weird was the page change before the DNS issuesâ€¦ It shows again how useful our Network Integrity Monitor solution can be to look at these issues.
