" target="_top"><em class="citetitle">VB</em>, February 2007, p.14</a>) and eight months after a slightly less well-attended review of products on its 64-bit version (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2007/08/vb-comparative-review-windows-vista-x64-business-edition
" target="_top"><em class="citetitle">VB</em>, August 2007, p.16</a>). During that time the platform has failed to make enormous headway in the marketplace, with most estimates reckoning it resides on at most 10% of the world&rsquo;s desktops, languishing far behind the dominant <em class="productname">XP</em>, which is thought still to hold sway on around 75% of systems.</p><p>The release of the first service pack for an operating system is often seen as a sign of maturity though, and SP1 for <em class="productname">Vista</em> could signal an upturn in the uptake of the platform. The upgrade promises a raft of improvements to performance and general functionality. SP1 was released shortly after the deadline for product submissions for this review. With at least some participants not yet able to get their hands on a copy for testing, even more than the usual number of bugs and unpredictable behaviours were expected, and with one of the largest sets of products yet seen on the VB100 test bench, I anticipated an arduous slog through the tests this month.</p><p>Initially a total of 40 products were submitted on the February 28th deadline. Many of these were new to the tests, including a pair of products based on the open source <em class="productname">ClamAV</em> detection technology, which promised to provide some interesting results. Several others returned after lengthy absences, and all the usual suspects were also present.</p><p>With such a huge number of products to get through I decided that any which could not be made to provide usable results after the standard three installs would have to be shelved. I also decided to streamline the results reporting process somewhat, if only to make the figures readable on the page. Thus, exact numbers of missed samples will not be reported in this month&#39;s comparative. As always, the percentages listed in the detection table represent the number of variants covered (or not) by the products, rather than the number of unique samples.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3743383"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p>Installation and set-up of <em class="productname">Vista</em> has become a fairly familiar process, and while the prettification of the install process itself always impresses me, my first act on seeing the garish, flashy interface is invariably to roll it back to its &lsquo;classic&rsquo; appearance, which seems much less intrusive over long periods of exposure. Doubtless the glitzy &lsquo;Aero&rsquo; look can be tweaked into something less nauseating, but this was not a process I was ready to spend any time on.</p><p>Application of the service pack was less painful than I had feared. Once installed, it seemed to make no obvious difference to the way things ran, although I did notice considerably fewer crashes and blue-screens than in previous tests. As in those earlier runs a user with minimal rights was created, to measure integration with user access controls and so on, but I expected to have to switch to the admin user or even disable UAC entirely for some products.</p><p>The clean test sets saw a fairly substantial enlargement, with most of the sets used for speed measurement now fast approaching a good size for freezing. This will enable more useful comparisons of product speeds over time as platforms are revisited (assuming the test hardware manages to withstand the heavy usage). An especially large number of additions were made to the polymorphic sets, thanks to there having been numerous misses in those areas in recent months &ndash; the variants of W32/Virut which have already been known to cause widespread problems are now more fully represented, and this should continue to tax the participants&rsquo; detection abilities to the utmost.</p><p>The deadline for the test sets was February 25th, and with the January WildList having been available for a few weeks by then the WildList set was synchronized with that list. This meant a fairly large number of additions, but as the previous list saw some clearing out of older items the total number of variants in the core set remained around the usual level. The additions were dominated as usual by worms and bots such as W32/Ircbot and W32/Agent, with another handful of variants of W32/Virut and other nasty file infectors also joining the set for the first time.</p><p>I had hoped that this month would see the inclusion of a preliminary set of non-replicating malware, having spent some time gathering, validating and categorising new samples for this purpose. As a step towards this significant change, much of the older part of the test set has been moved aside into a &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; set, as a precursor to the eventual retirement of all older items. With the unexpectedly high turnout of products, and some unforeseen delays in getting the lab ready for testing, the final stages of implementing the new trojan set had to be put on hold. Pared-down selection was included in the test out of interest and to gather data for name-referencing, and a further expanded version of the set should be ready in time for the next review. Even without this new challenge, the potential both for false positives and incomplete detection of polymorphic items was increased considerably and it looked likely to be a tough month for the large crowd of products I dragged into the <em class="citetitle">VB</em> test lab.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4638793"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4514632"></a>AEC Trustport Antivirus 2.8.0.3001</h3></div></div></div><p>After a lengthy spell atop the scoreboard with near immaculate detection rates thanks to an intensive multi-engine design, <em class="productname">Trustport</em>&rsquo;s performance dipped a little in recent tests which coincided with the product having a new set of engines under its bonnet. The version provided for this test was different again, with only the <em class="phrase">Norman</em> and <em class="phrase">AVG</em> engines in use this time. The look and feel of the product also seemed a little different, with the interface laid out in a pleasant and logical fashion, with access to the full range of configurations users of such a serious product should expect. The installation process was straightforward, requiring the administrator password and a reboot to complete.</p><p>In default mode, the &lsquo;intensive&rsquo; settings option was selected, with all files and most archive types checked in both modes. As a result, scanning speeds were less than stellar and on-access overheads were on the high side. However, the product remained stable even under heavy bombardment and the system remained responsive throughout. Detection rates were solid, and with the WildList covered without problems <em class="productname">Trustport</em> regains its VB100 certified status.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3555257"></a>Agnitum Outpost Security Suite Pro 6.0.2282.253.0485</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Agnitum</em>&rsquo;s suite features a diverse set of security functions, and under <em class="productname">Vista</em> the installer requires both the administrator password and confirmation that the user does indeed want to install the software. After the obligatory reboot a message alerted me that a driver had failed to load, warning that functionality may be impaired, and the on-access scanner did seem to be working erratically. After a second reboot the error and related instability disappeared and all seemed to operate properly.</p><p>With a colourful and easy-to-use interface and a decent selection of options, testing proved a pleasure. Reporting was a little odd at times though, not least in the set where the Eicar test file was used to measure the depth of archive scanning &ndash; while in most types of archive the test file was described as &lsquo;malware&rsquo;, when stored in .tgz format it was labelled a virus and given a higher risk rating. This minor quibble aside, detection was pretty good throughout, with a few suspect packed files pointed out in the clean sets but no false positives. In the WildList set, however, a handful of samples from one of the newly expanded W32/Virut sets were missed, denying <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em> a VB100 award this time.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4099334"></a>Ahnlab V3 Internet Security 7.0 Platinum Enterprise</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Ahnlab</em>&rsquo;s latest suite is a good-looking beast &ndash; glossy without being flashy &ndash; and installs simply, with the administrator password required but no reboot necessary. The main interface is similarly straightforward, offering some basic configuration &ndash; enough at least to get through the <em class="citetitle">VB</em> testing process without difficulty.</p><p>Logging seemed a little odd until I realised it had a hard-coded size limit for the log file, which meant that large chunks of precious detection records were being discarded before they could be saved. A somewhat laborious process of splitting the test sets up into several smaller chunks and scanning each separately got around this problem.</p><p>The product showed fairly good detection rates. A smattering of misses were recorded on access in the WildList set, thanks to some file extensions which are not scanned by default but are used by some worm variants for spreading. Thus, despite achieving full detection in manual scans and managing to avoid false positives across the expanded clean sets, <em class="phrase">Ahnlab</em> does not reach the required standard for a VB100 award on this occasion.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2113230"></a>Alwil avast! 4.7.1098</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Alwil</em>&rsquo;s submission was troubled by some missing data, the problem being given away by the product running suspiciously quickly through the on-access tests. Once the correct files were in place, after an installation process which required no password for the normal user but did insist on a reboot, quite the opposite result was obtained. Speeds remained excellent over the clean sets but slowed right down when faced with large numbers of infected files. The entire system became bogged down in the process, and after leaving it to finish overnight another reboot was needed to pull itself together. Some investigation hinted that this was perhaps a result of the product deleting each infected file without prompting, despite the &lsquo;interactive&rsquo; setting being selected. On demand things were less troublesome, with the action dialog appearing as usual with its friendly &lsquo;apply to all&rsquo; option, and these scans sped through at a lightning pace.</p><p>The dual interface system has never been a favourite of mine, but here it seemed steady and responsive except during the on-access incident mentioned above, which does not reflect any likely real-world situation. Settings seemed plentiful, with defaults ignoring archives but full scanning available for those who want it, and detection rates were reasonable as ever. However, a set of file infectors recently added to the WildList set were missed, and a single item in the clean set was mistakenly flagged as malware, and thus <em class="phrase">Alwil</em> misses out on a VB100 by a whisker.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3352174"></a>AVG 7.5.516</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AVG</em> (formerly known as <em class="phrase">Grisoft</em>) provided the shiny new version of its product for a recent standalone review (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2008/03/avg-internet-security-8
" target="_top"><em class="citetitle">VB</em>, March 2008, p.18</a>), and it was with some disappointment that the earlier incarnation was received for this month&rsquo;s test, the new interface having impressed me considerably. This one required the administrator password to install as well as when changing settings, which seemed a sensible way to go about things. The available configuration, once I had managed to refamiliarise myself with its somewhat arcane layout, appeared to offer the option to scan all file types on access. However, this did not seem to cover archives, or even files with unusual extensions, which remained resolutely undetected. The settings also seemed to revert after a reboot, and having shut down the system over a long weekend I found, much to my annoyance, that the same scan I had run previously was now eating up my test collection.</p><p>Perhaps aided by the fact that it ignored many file types, speeds were excellent, and detection rates were also pretty good. With nothing missed in the Wild and no false positives, <em class="productname">AVG</em> earns its first VB100 award under its new company name.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3623426"></a>Avira AntiVir Windows Workstation 7.06.00.507</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Avira</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">AntiVir</em> is another product that is familiar from many previous tests, this one offering a much more rational interface and a great flexibility of configuration.

As a result, <em class="phrase">Rising</em> does not quite make it to a VB100 award this time.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3106846"></a>Security Coverage PC Live</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="productname">PC Live</em> marks the first appearance of the open-source <em class="productname">ClamAV</em> engine on the VB100 test bench, though it was not the only product based on this engine to be submitted (more on this later). Like many commercial products in the open-source world, <em class="productname">PC Live</em> is provided as a free tool funded by paid-for support, and the interface is bright and colourful, apparently aiming at the PC novice market with its 1950s soap powder stylings.</p><p>As a result, configuration is less than ideal for my requirements, with logging particularly awkward, but things seemed to run pretty smoothly and stability was not a problem. Scanning speeds were rather impressive on access, but less so on demand, with some of the scans of the clean sets abandoned after having been left to run longer than any of the rest of the field, hinting at some kind of snagging issue. Detection results were not excellent, with a pronounced difference between on-demand and on-access scores and with large numbers of clean files blocked on access with no explanation. This implies that the on-access side of things also needs a little improvement.</p><p>With the <em class="productname">ClamAV</em> technology now backed by a commercial firm this could well prove a contender for a VB100 award in the near future, but for now a number of WildList misses and a false positive deny <em class="phrase">Security Coverage</em> its first VB100 award.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4402671"></a>Sophos Anti-Virus 7.0.7</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="productname">Sophos</em> is a much more familiar product, and another that has changed little for some time. It has a solid simplicity about it which has become an increasingly welcome sight on the test bench, providing respite from the strange and bewildering array of newcomers. Installing the product and opening the interface brings up a confirmation prompt but no password is needed.</p><p>As an enterprise-level product there is, of course, a full range of configuration options, making testing a breeze. Speeds were impressive, even with all files and archive types enabled on access, and detection was pretty good across the sets. Once again, however, a couple of samples of the trickiest of those Virut variants were not detected, and <em class="productname">Sophos</em> misses out on a VB100 award this month.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2953407"></a>Symantec Norton Anti-Virus 15.5.0.23</h3></div></div></div><p>Despite having tested a wide range of anti-malware products on a regular basis for some years, and despite <em class="phrase">Symantec</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Norton AntiVirus</em> being one of the biggest and most widely used products on the market, this is the first time our paths have crossed in any serious fashion.</p><p>Initial impressions were not good, the product presenting a rather sickly look with its gaudy yellow on a background of shimmering black, and presenting a few error messages about the &lsquo;service framework&rsquo; having stopped working as well as some nondescript internal errors.</p><p>In spite of this the product seemed to run pretty solidly with no problems in detection &ndash; this took some time to work out though, as the product defaults to removing or disinfecting items, with virtually no configuration options available to the user. This meant that on-access results had to be gathered by means of checking remaining files for changes, and the on-demand scan needed to be left overnight to complete its lengthy operations. It then needed to be re-run as I had missed the unobtrusive button needed to save the scanning log, which is not available from the history screen.</p><p>At the end of all this everything seemed okay, with splendid detection rates and no false positives. As a result, <em class="productname">Norton AntiVirus</em> gains a VB100 award, but does not make any new friends.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2953410"></a>Trend Micro Internet Security 16.10.1063</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Trend Micro</em>&rsquo;s product is another slick and professional piece of work from an industry giant, and again seemed to exhibit some distinctly flaky behaviour.</p><p>After a complex installation process, thanks to the test lab&rsquo;s lack of an outside connection and the need to update various components manually, the on-demand scanning seemed not to work, both from the &lsquo;custom scan&rsquo; area of the main interface and from the context menu option. This oddity was quickly resolved by starting a full system scan, which worked without a hitch, then stopping it; the other scanning options suddenly became properly responsive.</p><p>Configuration was pleasingly thorough, although the custom scan did insist on checking the memory, registry and system areas each time, which became rather tiresome when running a series of small quick scans as part of the speed test, and rendered gathering times for these scans somewhat inexact.</p><p>Despite this, scanning speeds turned out to be fairly good and detection rates were reasonable, but a small number of file infectors were missed in the WildList set and a couple of items in the clean set were labelled as &lsquo;TROJ_Generic&rsquo;. As a result <em class="phrase">Trend</em> does not qualify for the VB100 award on this occasion.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4393261"></a>VirusBuster Professional 6.0.191</h3></div></div></div><p>A much more pleasant experience was had with <em class="productname">VirusBuster</em>. The installation process sped through in a few steps from the admin password, via a licence code to full operation in a few moments. The interface is a tried and trusted one &ndash; not a favourite thanks to a little complexity in the on-demand task design, but perfectly usable and logically designed. Scanning was remarkably speedy and configuration plentiful, although the addition of &lsquo;all files&rsquo; to the on-access mode apparently did not cover archive types.</p><p>The manual scans were a little difficult to monitor, presenting no information on their progress; the only way to tell when one was finished was to watch the greyed-out buttons for a return to normal.</p><p>Detection was at its usual fairly high level, but as expected from testing a few other products using the same detection technology this month, a small handful of samples from one of the expanded sets of W32/Virut samples &ndash; a different strain this time from those causing trouble for most other products &ndash; went undetected, and <em class="productname">VirusBuster</em> misses out on a VB100 award.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4705983"></a>Webroot Spy Sweeper with AntiVirus 5.5.7.124</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="productname">Webroot</em> is by tradition an anti-spyware product and thus operates in a slightly different style from the majority of other products on test; like some of the other products its on-access detection is not always sparked by simple file access, and had to be measured by copying the collections to the system. Some scanning of file accesses did seem to be happening though, judging by the slight delays running over the clean sets. These scanning speeds are recorded for interest, but do not represent full scanning.</p><p>On demand things were pretty speedy, and scans were completed without much difficulty despite there being a shortage of configuration options. Once the logs had been tracked down, the results were processed and tallied pretty closely with those of the <em class="productname">Sophos</em> engine powering the product. Unfortunately the similarity extended to the pair of missed Virut samples which also upset <em class="productname">Webroot</em>&rsquo;s efforts to earn another VB100.</p><p><span class="italic"><i>Please refer to the PDF for test data</i></span></p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2957825"></a>Untested products</h2></div></div></div><p>With the exceptionally large number of products taking part this month, a few problems along the way were only to be expected. Most products were eventually coaxed into producing some usable results, but a handful were left by the wayside after taking up more than their fair share of testing time.</p><p>A regular participant in recent tests, <em class="productname">iolo AntiVirus</em> was provided initially as a full version with licence code; unfortunately this version needed access to the Internet to further validate the installation. A plea to the developers brought forth a second version with the option of running in temporary trial mode, and this at least reached the installation stage. Once up and running, however, it insisted that the trial allowance had expired in mid-2007 (despite the build apparently dating from late February 2008); repeated retries failed to persuade the product to enable its protection features, and with many more products jostling for space on the test bench I regrettably decided to spend no further time on <em class="productname">iolo</em> this month.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, a second <em class="productname">ClamAV</em>-based product was also entered for the test, a fully open-source project called <em class="productname">Moon Secure Anti-Virus</em> with the delightful tagline &lsquo;Anti-Virus from Space&rsquo;. The product proved well designed, reasonably stable and easy to use, but had been set up such that its on-access scanning would activate only on full execution. The hard-working developers quickly provided patches to enable full on-read scanning, but time was closing in and when these could not be made to work after a couple of attempts it was decided that <em class="productname">Moon Secure</em> would have to wait a couple of months before its full debut in the VB100 comparative &ndash; which should allow the developers sufficient time to perfect their product.</p><p><em class="phrase">PC Tools</em> submitted two products to this month&rsquo;s test. Alongside the straight anti-virus product was submitted the better-known <em class="productname">Spyware Doctor</em> with additional anti-virus functionality. This seemed to operate in a similar fashion to its stablemate and <em class="productname">Moon Secure</em>, with on-access scanning activated only when fully executing samples, and again the options to adjust this did not seem to function properly. As running each sample in all our infected and clean sets would be an enormously complex and time-consuming task, and as <span><em class="phrase">PC Tools</em></span> already had a product successfully put through the testing process, it was decided that <em class="productname">Spyware Doctor</em> should also be dropped from the test, having taken up enough testing time unprofitably.</p><p>As these products fell into the category of &lsquo;untestable&rsquo; no judgement can be given on their performance, and they will not be counted as entries in the VB100 history listings.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2957829"></a>Results tables</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Detection_sm.gif" /></div><p>Download a full size <a href="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Detection.gif" target="_top">detection rates</a> table.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Throughput_sm.gif" /></div><p>Download a full size <a href="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Throughput.gif" target="_top">on-demand throughput </a>table.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Lag_sm.gif" /></div><p>Download a full size <a href="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Lag.gif" target="_top">on-access time lag</a> table.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Archives_sm.gif" /></div><p>Download a full size <a href="/uploads/images/figures/2008/04/Archives.gif" target="_top">archive scanning</a> table.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4663115"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div></div><p>Another bumper crop of products and another draining month of intensive testing to a tight deadline.</p><p>Again a large number of issues have emerged from the test, most of them caused by a few variants of polymorphic file infectors, some of which have been resident on the WildList for some months and are now represented in greater numbers in the test set to provide a more accurate indication of detection rates. These sets, some of which previously contained only a handful of samples, now contain at least 50 and in some cases 100 or more; I would like to have each polymorphic item in the test sets represented by at least 500 samples, and over time will continue to expand the sets until they reach this sort of level. With many of these items continuing to trip up a variety of products, it seems sensible to have them as thoroughly represented in the test sets as possible.</p><p>Issues of stability and unexpected behaviour also caused problems this month, many of which seem likely to be a result of the updated platform. Hopefully many of these issues will be resolved as the service pack becomes more widely implemented by users and more fully tested by developers.</p><p>For me, the biggest headache of all was the sheer scale of the test, with a massive 40 products taking part. While a few of these didn&rsquo;t quite make it to the final line-up, they still took a hefty share of testing time, each having been given several retries before being deemed untestable. With a final total of 37, the field shows no signs of shrinking, and the test on <em class="productname">Windows XP</em> coming up in the summer looks likely to be even more heavily subscribed than this one &ndash; unless the developers are scared off by the rash of failed products this time around.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2569802"></a>Technical details</h2></div></div></div><p><b>Test environment.&nbsp;</b>Tests were run on identical machines with <em class="productname">AMD Athlon64</em> 3800+ dual core processors, 1 GB RAM, 40 GB and 200 GB dual hard disks, DVD/CD-ROM and 3.5-inch floppy drive, all running <em class="productname">Microsoft Windows Vista Business Edition SP1</em> (32-bit).</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Any developers interested in submitting products for VB&#39;s comparative reviews should contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#38525750561650594f5d4b784e514a4d4b5a4c56165b5755" target="_top"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e58f8a8d8bcb8d84928096a5938c97909687918bcb868a88">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
