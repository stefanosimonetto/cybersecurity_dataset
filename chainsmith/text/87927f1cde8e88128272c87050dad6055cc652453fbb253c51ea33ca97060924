Symantec False Positive

If you’ve got Symantec Antivirus and you’ve got Webroot Spysweeper, than you probably have seen a Backdoor.Graybird detection today. This is a false positive. The files typically detected are in the temp director and named mc21.tmp or mc22.tmp in my experience.
I have called Symantec support, the next set of virus defs released should solve this problem. The current set of Rapid Release defs do fix this but I’d rather wait for “certified” definitions.
