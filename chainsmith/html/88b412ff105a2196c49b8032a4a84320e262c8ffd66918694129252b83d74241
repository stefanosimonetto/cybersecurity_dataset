Together, they form the foundation of addressing, routing and hosting on the Internet. Most of the current reputation systems used for network-level threat detection derive scores for IPs, BGP prefixes or ASNs based on hosted content. </p><p>In this paper, we take a novel approach by exploring the AS graph which models the interconnections between ASNs. We uncover hotspots of maliciousness by analysing AS graph topology, hosted content and IP space reservation, and shed some light on suspicious relationships between ASNs and abusive IP sub-allocations. </p><p>This exploration methodology enriches classical scoring mechanisms that are based on the counting of malicious domains/IPs hosted on ASNs. This method also provides actionable intelligence and can be used pre-emptively to detect and block malicious IP infrastructures before or immediately after they are set up for waging malware campaigns. We will go over multiple relevant use cases of attack domains detected by this system, such as trojan C&amp;Cs, exploit kit domains and malware domains. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3488216"></a>Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>Classical reputation systems used for network-level threat detection assign scores to IPs, BGP prefixes and ASNs based on counting the number of hosted malicious domains or IPs. In this study, our goal is to assess malicious IP ranges in certain ASNs from a new perspective. We look beyond the simple counting of the number of bad domains and IPs hosted on prefixes of an ASN, by exploring the topology of the AS graph, and looking at a finer granularity than the BGP prefix (sub-allocated ranges within BGP prefixes). </p><p>Previous research has been conducted on malicious ASNs. For example, in [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.1">1</a></span>], Stone-Gross <span class="emphasis"><em>et al.</em></span> assign scores to rogue ASNs based on the number of events involving hosts engaged in phishing or spamming, hosting drive-by download malware, or generating botnet traffic. In [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.2">2</a></span>] and [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.3">3</a></span>], the authors use visualization to track security incidents and malware events drawn from blacklist databases, and [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.4">4</a></span>] explores ASNs providing transit for malicious ASNs. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2252520"></a>ASN graph</h2></div></div></div><p>Every globally routable network on the Internet is identified by an Autonomous System Number (ASN). An Autonomous System (AS) represents a collection of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes or CIDRs administered by the same entity and sharing a common routing policy. In practice, an AS announces the prefixes under its authority to its peering ASNs, and these announcements propagate across routers where they are stored to help with routing decisions. </p><p>The BGP table is the accumulation of all announced prefixes with their reachability information (AS paths). An AS path is a sequence of ASNs through which an announced prefix can be reached [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.5">5</a></span>]. The BGP table is not only important for packet forwarding and loop detection on every Internet router, it is also very useful to study the evolution of the Internet from a topology and security threat perspective. For that, we need to build an AS graph which represents the interconnections between peering ASNs. </p><p>In this study, we built an AS graph using publicly available data sources. Our primary source is the Route Views data from the University of Oregon [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.6">6</a></span>], which provides a global BGP table by collecting BGP data from hundreds of Autonomous Systems worldwide. We can also use the BGP tables from all the routers we operate within our <span class="emphasis"><em>OpenDNS</em></span> global network of 23 data centres. The current global BGP table counts 500,000+ IPv4 BGP prefixes and 46,000+ ASNs. </p><p>Other valuable data sources that are useful for studying the IP, BGP prefix and ASN landscapes are the CIDR report [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.7">7</a></span>] and Hurricane Electric Internet Services website [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.8">8</a></span>]. </p><div class="figure"><a id="figure.1"></a><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Route Views website." src="/uploads/images/figures/2014/11/Mahjoub-1.jpg" /></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Route Views website.</b></p></div><p>(Click <a href="/uploads/images/figures/2014/11/Mahjoub-1-large.jpg" target="_top">here</a> to view a larger version of Figure 1.)</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4368280"></a>Building the ASN graph</h2></div></div></div><p>BGP data is collected in MRT format. When we dump it in text format, an entry is as follows: </p><p>TABLE_DUMP2|1392422403|B|96.4.0.55|11686|67.215.94.0/24|11686 4436 2914 36692|IGP|96.4.0.55|0|0||NAG|| </p><p>We mark the fields that are of interest to us in bold. In this entry, 67.215.94.0/24 is an example network prefix, and 11686 4436 2914 36692 is one associated AS path. The ASN that appears at the end of the AS path is the origin ASN of the prefix, which is 36692 in this case. Typically, it is the ASN that announces (advertises) that prefix. </p><p>We represent the AS graph as a directed graph, where an ASN is denoted by a node and there is a directed edge between an ASN and every one of its upstream ASNs. For example, in the BGP table entry above, 36692 is the origin ASN for 67.215.94.0/24, and 2914 is an upstream ASN of 36692 (the last ASN before reaching the origin ASN when packets are travelling towards an IP in the origin ASN), therefore that entry can be graphically represented as shown in <a href="#figure.2">Figure 2</a>. </p><div class="figure"><a id="figure.2"></a><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Graphic representation of an entry of the BGP table." src="/uploads/images/figures/2014/11/Mahjoub-2.jpg" /></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Graphic representation of an entry of the BGP table.</b></p></div><p>An alternative method to build the AS graph is to use the entire AS path on every prefix entry of the BGP table. In this case, from the example above, we can build the following edges in the graph: 36692-&gt;2914, 2914-&gt;4436, 4436-&gt;11686. The AS graph is built by parsing the BGP table line by line. </p><p>In the directed AS graph, an AS node can have incoming and/or outgoing edges. The outgoing edges point to upstream ASNs and incoming edges originate from downstream ASNs. Below, we define a few terms describing the AS graph nodes from a directed graph topological perspective [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.9">9</a></span>]. </p><p>A &lsquo;source&rsquo; ASN is an ASN that only has outgoing edges and no incoming edges, i.e. the ASN only has upstream ASNs that it relies upon for connectivity and for propagating its prefix announcements. A &lsquo;leaf&rsquo; ASN is a special case where an ASN has a single outgoing edge and no incoming edge. This is described as a &lsquo;stub&rsquo; ASN in the BGP routing terminology. </p><p>We define ASNs that are &lsquo;source&rsquo; ASNs (or &lsquo;leaves&rsquo;) that share the same parents (upstream ASNs) as &lsquo;sibling&rsquo; ASNs. For clarity, we will use the more intuitive term &lsquo;peripheral&rsquo; ASNs to denote source ASNs for the remainder of this paper. </p><p>The BGP table/ASN graph is constantly changing as new prefixes (with their AS paths) are announced, old prefixes are dropped, new ASNs are registered and start advertising prefixes, and others cease to exist and withdraw all their prefixes. Most common changes are probably caused by new AS relations, new peers or previously unseen relations. </p><p>This dynamic state can be the result of multiple factors: intentional technical and business decisions, human errors, hardware faults, route hijacking, etc. By parsing the entries of the BGP table, we can extract two types of useful data: the upstream and downstream ASNs of every ASN, and IP to ASN maps (via prefix to ASN mapping). For this, we can load the prefix and the origin ASN data into a radix tree. With the radix tree (given an IP as input), we can quickly find the best matching prefix, and consequently, matching ASN. </p><p>Alternatives are to use services like BGPMON.net (e.g whois -h whois.bgpmon.net 8.8.8.8),<span class="emphasis"><em> Team Cymru</em></span> IP to ASN mapping [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.10">10</a></span>], GeoIPASNum.dat from maxmind [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.11">11</a></span>], or http://ipinfo.io/ (e.g. curl ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8/org returns the AS number and AS name of <span class="emphasis"><em>Google Inc</em></span>.). In this study, we discuss interesting patterns in the AS graph topology &ndash; typically, suspicious peripheral ASNs that are siblings, i.e. they share common parents (upstream ASNs) in the AS graph. By clustering peripheral nodes in the AS graph by country, we found that certain peripheral sibling ASNs in a few countries have been delivering similar suspicious campaigns.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4598549"></a>Use case 1: suspicious sibling peripheral ASNs</h2></div></div></div><p>During manual investigation of suspicious domains and IPs that we detected in our traffic, we observed several cases of sibling peripheral ASNs that are hosting similar malware payloads. In this section, we will describe one such use case. </p><p>In <a href="#figure.3">Figure 3</a>, we show a snapshot of a suspicious ASN subgraph taken on 8 January 2014, consisting of 10 sibling peripheral ASNs (57604, 8287, 50896, 49236, 29004, 45020, 44093, 48949, 49720 and 50818) sharing two upstream ASNs (48361 and 31500). We colour the ASNs that were hosting malicious payloads in red. The malicious payload is identified by some anti-virus vendors as Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Ldmon.A [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.12">12</a></span>], [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.13">13</a></span>] and described as a Trickler [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.14">14</a></span>].

In this example, it is AS48031, XSERVER-IP-NETWORK-AS PE Ivanov Vitaliy Sergeevich 86400 that had a single upstream provider, AS15626. AS48031 has been hosting browser-based ransomware, porn sites, spam, and radical forums. </p><p>Browser-based ransomware, or &lsquo;Browlock&rsquo;, is a rudimentary piece of ransomware that consists of an HTML page that loads when the user visits the browlock domain. It locks the browser screen (through HTML or JavaScript code) and demands payment, supposedly either for possession of illegal material or for usage of illegal software [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.15">15</a></span>].

In this type of infection, visitors are lead to the exploit landing sites through malvertising campaigns, then malware is dropped on victims&rsquo; machines (e.g. Zbot). The results of the study were published in [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.17">17</a></span>]. </p><p>For several months, <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span> IP ranges had been abused. Notably, the IPs were used exclusively for hosting Nuclear Exploit subdomains, with no other sites sharing the IPs. These IPs were reserved in small ranges from <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH Canada</em></span> and set up with identical services (nmap fingerprint). Consulting ARIN&rsquo;s referral whois database showed the reserved ranges and customer IDs. As an evasive measure, on 7 February, the bad actors moved their activities to besthosting.ua, a Ukrainian hosting provider. RIPE&rsquo;s whois service, which covers European IP space, does not always give details of reserved ranges and customers, but in this case the Ukrainian IPs were still set up with identical services. Therefore, we flagged them as prone to serve the same Nuclear campaign. On 14 February, the bad actors moved to a Russian provider, pinspb.ru, with a similar bulk IP range set-up. On 22 February, they moved back to <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span>, notably changing their MO: the IPs being used have been allocated and used in the past for other content. This could be an evasion technique or a case of resource recycling. </p><p>However, although the bad actors have migrated between hosting providers to host the Nuclear Exploit serving domains, they still kept the name servers infrastructure (authoritative for the Nuclear domains) on ranges reserved on <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span> by the same customers, which allows us still to track them. Thanks to a great collaboration with the non-profit security research group <span class="emphasis"><em>MalwareMustDie</em></span>, a large number of Nuclear Exploit domains that were active at the time have since been taken down [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.18">18</a></span>]. </p><p>Subsequently, bad actors have been circulating between <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span> and other hosting providers.

As hosting providers have become more aggressive in suspending rogue customers&rsquo; accounts and swifter in taking down malware IPs, and as bad actors choose hosting providers on IP space where the RIRs&rsquo; whois service does not always provide full information about reserved ranges and customers (e.g. RIPE), the first technique might not always work. The second technique of fingerprint tracking, however, still provides accurate results when combined with other intelligence. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2167952"></a>Use case 5: detecting malicious subdomains under compromised domains</h2></div></div></div><p>In this section, we discuss the results of a five-month study we conducted between February and June 2014 that followed the study of use case 3. For this project, we designed a system to pre-emptively detect malicious subdomains injected under compromised domains (particularly <span class="emphasis"><em>GoDaddy</em></span> domains) and track their IP infrastructure. The phenomenon of compromised <span class="emphasis"><em>GoDaddy</em></span> domains serving malware has been around for at least two years [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.19">19</a></span>]. The compromise can happen through at least two methods: hacking <span class="emphasis"><em>GoDaddy</em></span> accounts or injecting malicious redirection scripts into vulnerable <span class="emphasis"><em>GoDaddy</em></span> websites. When the compromise is successful, subdomains (third-level domains) are injected under the <span class="emphasis"><em>GoDaddy</em></span> domains (second-level domains), and these subdomains resolve to malicious sites.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4416974"></a>Most abused ASNs</h3></div></div></div><p>By monitoring this threat from February 2014 to the present day, we observed that the subdomains resolve to IPs serving exploit kit attacks (typically Nuclear [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.20">20</a></span>], [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.21">21</a></span>] and Angler [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.22">22</a></span>], [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.23">23</a></span>]), and also browser-based ransomware. We recorded several hundred IPs hosting these malicious subdomains over the period of the study. In <a href="#figure.8">Figure 8</a>, we show the top ASNs hosting these malware subdomains over that period. The x-axis represents the AS numbers, and the y-axis represents the percentage of IPs from the total dataset that map to a particular ASN. </p><div class="figure"><a id="figure.8"></a><div class="mediaobject"><img alt="Top hosting malicious ASNs." src="/uploads/images/figures/2014/11/Mahjoub-8.jpg" /></div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Top hosting malicious ASNs.</b></p></div><p>We see that the top five abused ASNs are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>16276 OVH SAS</p></li><li><p>24961 myLoc managed IT AG</p></li><li><p>15003 Nobis Technology Group, LLC</p></li><li><p>41853 LLC NTCOM</p></li><li><p>20473 Choopa, LLC</p></li></ul></div><p>AS16276, which is <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span>, hosted 18% of the total malicious IPs. In this specific case, since the abuse of <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span> has been exposed through February 2014 (particularly for hosting Nuclear Exploit domains [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.17">17</a></span>]), bad actors have changed their MO: they switched temporarily to other hosting providers, and started using recycled IPs (not reserved exclusively for exploit domains). Additionally, <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span> took action by suspending rogue accounts. However, by monitoring the compromised domains&rsquo; campaigns, we observed that <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span> was still being abused by bad actors to host malicious content. These were the general changes in the bad actors&rsquo; MO that we observed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>From a domain perspective, for a while, bad actors have been abusing various ccTLDs (e.g. .pw, .in.net, .ru, etc.) facilitated by rogue or victim registrars and resellers. Then, they supplemented that approach with using compromised domains, particularly <span class="emphasis"><em>GoDaddy</em></span> domains, under which they inject subdomains to host exploit kit landing URLs and Browlock. (Notice that using compromised domains for attacks goes further back in the past for other different campaigns.)</p></li><li><p>From an IP perspective, bad actors used to bring the attack hosting IPs online in contiguous chunks, then they started bringing them up in randomized sets or one IP at a time.</p></li><li><p>The other notable fact is that bad actors used to abuse <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH Canada</em></span> (attached to ARIN) where rogue customers were reserving re-assigned small ranges (/27, /28, /29, etc.). By consulting the ARIN RWhois database, it was possible to correlate the rogue customers with the IP ranges they reserved and therefore predict and block the IP infrastructures they set up for exploit kit attacks. As the adversaries changed MO, this method of tracking became less effective.</p></li><li><p>The shift became clear when they started to use ranges on <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span>&rsquo;s European IP space (which is attached to RIPE) more frequently, as well as other European providers. Typically, we saw small gaming hosting providers being abused among other platforms.</p></li></ul></div><p>Additionally, although the standard geolocation of <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span> European IP space maps to France (FR), the attack IP ranges were reserved from <span class="emphasis"><em>OVH</em></span>&rsquo;s server pools in various European countries (France, Belgium, Italy, UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Netherlands, Finland, Czech Republic and Russia). This clearly shows that the adversaries are diversifying their hosting assets, which affords them redundancy and evasive capabilities. Notice also that RIPE has stricter data protection laws so it would be more difficult to obtain information about customers, and that could explain the shift in hosting infrastructures by the bad actors. </p><p>More generally, we list a few of the small-scale hosting providers involved in hosting the attack subdomains. These hosting providers could either be abused, complicit with the bad actors, or simply lax about the maliciousness of the content they host. Note that the rogue providers among these will often switch prefixes by dropping dirty ones and reserving new ones from the backbone providers to which they are attached. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>http://king-servers.com/en/ has been observed to host exploit kit domains (Angler, Styx), porn, dating sites and pharma sites [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.24">24</a></span>], [<span class="citation"><a href="#citation.25">25</a></span>].
