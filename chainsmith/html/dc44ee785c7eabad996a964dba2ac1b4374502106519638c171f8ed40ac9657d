Vendors of a number of new products who were interested in putting their software forward for the VB100 certification had been in discussion with us for some time, with timing or platform issues having prevented their entry into earlier tests. Meanwhile, the broad popularity of the <em class="productname">XP</em> platform as much as guaranteed that all the regular VB100 entrants would support it. With a handful of further new arrivals appearing in the weeks before the deadline, this proved to be a truly bumper crop, well outstripping previous records. </p><p> In a month that incorporated two national holidays, as well as my attendance at the <em class="phrase">Frisk</em> Antivirus Testing Workshop to keep me from the test lab (<a href="/virusbulletin/2007/06/av-industry-commments-anti-malware-testing
" target="_top">see p.2</a>), I anticipated some long days to get the comparative completed in time - particularly with so many new and unfamiliar products with which to wrestle. I could only hope for simple and responsive interfaces, rapid scanning times and clear and straightforward results. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2933959"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p><em class="productname">Windows XP</em>, first released with quite some fanfare in late 2001, came rapidly to dominate the home-user market with its advances over <em class="productname">Windows 98</em> and <em class="productname">ME</em>, and has also made steady inroads into the corporate sphere. The release of Service Pack 2 (SP2) in mid-2004, with some serious security improvements including the Windows Firewall and the Security Center, has boosted the platform&#39;s popularity and stability and made it almost a global standard. With a third service pack expected some time next year, and <em class="productname">Windows Vista</em> still at the start of a long settling-down period before it becomes widespread, <em class="productname">XP</em> is sure to remain dominant for some time yet. </p><p> Setting up <em class="productname">Windows XP</em> has become a simple process for me after having repeated the task many times over the years, and all the familiar controls and settings are easy to find and use. The <em class="productname">Professional</em> edition was used for testing purposes, in case any of the corporate products required domain membership or any of the other add-ons not available in the home edition. With SP2 rolled into the installer I used, little further tweaking was required once the systems were running and talking to the test lab network. </p><p> Beyond the expansion of the WildList test set and a host of additions to the clean sets, the test collections remain fairly stable. The WildList used to compile the test sets - the February 2007 version released in mid-April - had a relatively small number of additions, which were dominated by W32/Sdbot and W32/Rbot variants, with a large number of older items falling from the list after a lengthy tenure. Most interesting among the additions were the file infectors, some more of the W32/Looked (aka Viking) variants that have been appearing in recent months, as well as W32/Fujacks (aka the Panda Burning Incense virus, among other bizarre names picked up in its flashes of media popularity). </p><p> I hoped again to include some more detailed speed test results, although I anticipated there being several products that would not fit into the testing methodology (especially regarding on-access tests where different products behave in wildly different ways when files are simply opened, copied, written to etc., rather than fully executed). </p><p> For the archive tests, I planned once more to test both with the default settings and with archive scanning switched on, to try to show reasonably equal measures across products. Again, I expected some products not to offer this level of configuration, and results are presented only in as much depth as it was possible to gather in the available time. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3748924"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3910733"></a>AEC Trustport Workstation Antivirus 2.5.0.970</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="productname">Trustport Anti-Virus</em> is available as a component of the broader <em class="productname">Trustport</em> suite, which was reviewed in <em class="citetitle">VB</em> in some depth a couple of months ago (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2007/03/aec-trustport-workstation
" target="_top">VB, March 2007, p.13</a>). The installation was thus a familiar affair. Halfway through the installation I was reminded to ensure that I had no other anti-virus solutions installed on my machine - quite a reasonable request since the four engines included with the product (<em class="productname">BitDefender</em>, <em class="productname">Ewido</em>, <em class="productname">Grisoft</em> and <em class="productname">Norman</em>) should be more than adequate for anyone. </p><p> No reboot was required at the end of the installation, and red shield and blue gem icons installed to the system tray indicated that protection was running smoothly. Accessing the configuration options from here, I found the interface sensible and highly responsive, and had on-access scanning temporarily disabled, the logging settings tuned up and the first on-demand scan under way in a matter of seconds. </p><p> With all four engines deployed for the on-demand mode, speeds were never likely to be as impressive as detection rates, but on access only two engines are in use and the slowdowns are not too severe. </p><p> With splendid detection throughout and not a false positive in sight, <em class="productname">Trustport</em> gets this bumper comparative off to a good start with a very well deserved VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>100.00%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4052986"></a>Agnitum Outpost Security Suite Pro</h3></div></div></div><p>The first of the barrage of newcomers to join the test this month, <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em>&#39;s product is an expansion of its well-known firewall offering, with virus detection provided by the <em class="productname">VirusBuster</em> engine. </p><p> Installing the product was a fairly straightforward affair, although I was asked if I wanted &#39;Advanced&#39; protection (recommended for more experienced users) or a &#39;Normal&#39; level (suitable for all). Since the advanced option was selected by default, I went with this mode. I was also offered an option to enable &#39;SmartScan&#39;, which is a system that can be used to speed up scanning using checksums of known good files, stored in hidden files. This I turned down for fairness in the speed tests, and a number of other setup options were trundled through before I could get my hands on the product proper. </p><p> The interface itself is attractive, with a tree menu showing its core functions and the product&#39;s various &#39;plugins&#39;, of which the &#39;anti-malware&#39; section was, of course, the most interesting to me. Each has its own configuration section, some stretching to several tabs, and some detailed status information was also provided. </p><p> Scanning was performed with ease, generally from the handy context-menu link, and was fast and stable. On-access protection was similarly solid and reliable. Detection across the zoo sets was in line with the results I would expect from the engine used, but some strange behaviour was encountered in the WildList set. Two samples, both with .pif extensions, were missed in the on-demand scan, and four different items, including a full set of one of the W32/Fujacks variants, were missed on access. This behavioural oddity spoils <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em>&#39;s chances of a VB100 at first attempt, but this product seems a likely contender for the award in future tests. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.92%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.55%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>87.82%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3454701"></a>AhnLab V3 Internet Security 2007</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> has been a regular and successful entrant in <em class="citetitle">VB</em>&#39;s comparative reviews over the last few years, and it was no surprise to see <em class="productname">V3</em> back on the test bench after a brief absence. The <em class="productname">Internet Security</em> suite includes the usual firewall, web and email protection facilities, from which a selection of required components could be made during installation, which also offered a pre-install scan and was ready to go without rebooting. </p><p> Initial impressions of the GUI were very good: it looked slick and attractive, with a prominent &#39;Settings&#39; button promising easy access to all the required controls. Attempting to run a few scans proved a little less straightforward than I had hoped, due to the requirement to set up a job and then run it, but a &#39;Run a virus scan&#39; option was added into context menus, making speed testing much easier. </p><p> Scanning speeds themselves were on the slow side on demand, especially with the option to scan archives enabled, but on-access speeds were remarkably fast, with little control of the depth of scanning available for this mode. </p><p> Logging has proved problematic with <em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> products in the past, and this occasion was no exception. Logs saved from the Log Viewer utility were invariably truncated to an apparently random size, but usable figures were obtained eventually, after splitting the scans into several sections. These, and the results of on-access blocking, showed samples to have been missed in all test sets, though not in vast numbers. In the WildList set three separate items were not detected, including the polymorphic W32/Polip.A, of which all 15 samples were missed, thus denying <em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> a VB100 this time around.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.79%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.79%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>98.97%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>92.83%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4737612"></a>Alwil avast! v.4.7 Professional Edition</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Alwil</em>&#39;s <em class="productname">avast!</em>, one of the best-known names in the home-user field thanks to the widely used free versions, is another regular in <em class="citetitle">VB</em> comparatives, and little was changed here from previous visits. As usual, the rather funky basic interface was avoided for most tests, with the &lsquo;Advanced&rsquo; control system providing ample functionality. </p><p> Again the system for setting up scan tasks proved a little fiddly for my purposes, but my familiarity with the interface has begun to pay off and the tests were completed quickly. Speeds were middling throughout, and detection likewise - neither flawless nor disappointingly lacking. </p><p> The product&rsquo;s reliability was carried over into the WildList set where nothing was missed, and likewise the clean sets, where only the usual single file labelled a &lsquo;Joke&rsquo; required noting.

Scanning is designed in the typical style of an anti-spyware product, with the full system and registry the default target, but individual areas can be scanned by switching off &lsquo;deep disk scanning&rsquo; and selecting the required folder. This gave some unusual speed results, with great attention paid to executable and binary files but little, perhaps sensibly, to media and documents. </p><p> On-access detection was obtained via the system&rsquo;s logging, as blocking was not sparked by simple file-opening. </p><p> A few times during testing the display faltered somewhat, with attempts to view scan histories producing only a &lsquo;Page not found&rsquo;-type error message, but logging to file seemed more stable. </p><p> Results were good across the board, closely matching the scores recorded by <em class="phrase">Norman</em>&rsquo;s own product, and with the WildList set amply covered and a single suspicious file in the clean set, another impressive-looking piece of software gets its first VB100 stamp of approval.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>99.90%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>81.94%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4432199"></a>Eset NOD32 Antivirus System 2.70.32</h3></div></div></div><p>The <em class="productname">Windows</em> version of <em class="productname">NOD32</em> is another very familiar product, little changed in the last several tests, although a major new release is promised in the coming months.

Austria-based <em class="phrase">Ikarus Software</em> also carries a range of server products for mail and web filtering, and the product is available as a six-month free trial. </p><p> The initial download is remarkably small at only slightly over 4 MB, but this must be supplemented by the virus definition data, which for this test measured around 7 MB. </p><p> Installation was prevented initially by the need for the <em class="productname">Microsoft .NET</em> framework, which apparently is downloaded automatically when the installer is run with web access. With this in place, the process continued with a check for other security software which may prevent full operation, and the offer to install <em class="productname">Adobe Reader</em> which is needed to access the documentation (which sadly only works when running from CD and was not included in my download edition). </p><p> With the installation complete and updates added, the product showed a small status display tool with details of the scanner, updater and on-access &lsquo;guard&rsquo;, but the main interface seemed unwilling to open at first. After several attempts and a reboot it suddenly started responding, and from then on seemed to suffer no such problems. Configuration was minimal and a little difficult to fathom, but once figured out, things got moving quite nicely. </p><p> While scanning the large infected sets much of the interface faded away and refused to respond, leaving me fearing a total crash, but checking back some time later I found it had returned to normal and the scan completed without serious incident. </p><p> On-access scanning was easier to run through, and analysis of the results showed good speeds, though detection across the infected sets was a little uneven, with a significant number of misses in the older DOS and polymorphic sets. These figures are magnified by some large sample sets however, and overall percentage scores are more impressive. </p><p> More importantly, a small handful of WildList viruses were missed, and several false positives were alerted on, including components of the <em class="productname">Nero</em> CD recording software, <em class="productname">Norton Ghost</em> and the <em class="productname">GoogleTalk</em> installer, all of which were labelled as trojans. This was enough to deny <em class="productname">Ikarus</em> its first VB100, but with a little work the product should be a solid contender for qualification in the near future. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.88%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.88%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>95.86%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>71.00%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3146607"></a>iolo AntiVirus 1.1.9</h3></div></div></div><p>Best known for its repair and optimization products, <em class="phrase">iolo</em> has built a considerable public profile with its presence on the shelves of high-street software outlets.

The final release to market is expected to be at around the same time as the publication of this review. </p><p> Things got off to a shaky start when my first stab at running the installation CD on a test machine proved a dead loss, the installer failing with an obscure error message. Resorting to the documentation, I found to my horror some lengthy instructions for the design of a security topology, which required a <em class="productname">Windows 2003</em> server on which to run the installer and from which to deploy to clients - this also needed such delights as <em class="productname">Microsoft SQL Server 2005 SP1</em>, <em class="productname">IIS</em> and <em class="productname">ASP.net</em>, the <em class="productname">.NET</em> framework 2.0, <em class="productname">MMC 3.0</em>, <em class="productname">GPMC SP1</em> and <em class="productname">WSUS</em>. While making moves to acquire these items, I asked the developers for a simpler client install method, which thankfully was provided and proved ample for my needs. </p><p> The user interface seemed rather simple, with less configurability than I would expect from a corporate product. Presumably most of this side of things is controlled from a proper management server, where available. Running most of the testing was fairly straightforward however, with the only problem being a complete absence of internal logging &ndash; detection details had to be gleaned from the system event log. </p><p> Scanning speeds were fairly reasonable, and detection seemed pretty thorough overall, <em class="phrase">Microsoft</em> having made some efforts at improving its coverage since the recent appearance of <em class="productname">OneCare</em> in <em class="citetitle">VB</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Vista</em> test. </p><p> Some slightly unusual behaviour was uncovered when a single file in the WildList set, a sample of W32/Tenga, was not blocked on access. Further investigation showed that the default action for this file was set to &lsquo;always allow&rsquo; (after detecting the file in an on-demand scan, selecting the &lsquo;apply action&rsquo; option either deleted, disinfected or quarantined other items, while this one was for some reason allowed to pass unfiltered). </p><p> Despite this problem, basic detection of the file was provided, and thus without having generated any false positives in the scan of the clean test set, <em class="productname">Forefront</em> just about qualifies under the rules of the VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>96.15%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4058883"></a>Microsoft Windows Live OneCare 1.5.1890.35</h3></div></div></div><p>My second attempt at testing <em class="productname">OneCare</em> was aided by some familiarity with the product, and with the special setup required to allow this web-centric software to operate without its connection to base.

Among the other functionality included was an offer to &lsquo;tune-up&rsquo; my system, with disk defragmentation etc. </p><p> Limited configuration did not extend to logging, and results, once parsed, showed full detection of the WildList, and again no false positives, so <em class="productname">OneCare</em> is also granted the VB100 this time.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>96.15%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3755084"></a>Microworld eScan Internet Security for Windows 9.0.714.1</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Microworld Technology</em> provides a wide range of server and gateway products alongside those for desktops, including Linux.

Some hefty XML logs proved a little much for my poor tired system to bear, but scanning speeds were good and results looked promising.

The product is well-designed throughout, both visually appealing and easy to navigate, and includes several useful ideas. </p><p> During installation I was informed that the <em class="productname">Windows</em> firewall would be deactivated, to be replaced with the product&rsquo;s own firewall. I was also presented with a list of vulnerabilities detected on my bare system for which patches have since been released. </p><p> Detection was decent, if not among the most thorough, but nothing from the WildList was missed and no mistakes were made in the clean sets, resulting in another VB100 for <em class="phrase">Trend Micro</em>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>99.68%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>93.10%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4909854"></a>VirusBuster VirusBuster Professional 2006 v.5.2</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">VirusBuster</em> is, for once, not the last product in this test alphabetically - but the offering is one that I never mind getting around to at the end of a test period, with its clear and logical design and pleasing stability. </p><p> While the layout of the on-demand scanning system is not my favourite, right-click scanning avoided much need to use this, and gave good speed results and a small selection of missed files in the zoo sets. </p><p><em class="phrase">VirusBuster</em>&rsquo;s engine has already appeared in this test, implemented in some of the newcomers&rsquo; products, but the problems exhibited there were not in evidence here, and with only a warning that a zipped file in the clean set may be an attempted zipbomb, <em class="phrase">VirusBuster</em> wins another VB100 award. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>87.82%</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4356510"></a>Webroot Spy Sweeper 5.5</h3></div></div></div><p>The final product on the list is yet another newcomer. <em class="phrase">Webroot</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Spy Sweeper</em> has long been a popular and well-regarded player in the anti-spyware field; the company has been around for over ten years, and also produces firewall, performance management and content-filtering software. <em class="productname">Spy Sweeper</em> added anti-virus protection and detection late last year, incorporating the <em class="phrase">Sophos</em> engine into version 5.2 of the product. </p><p> Installation of <em class="productname">Spy Sweeper</em> was a simple process, although some tweaking was required to add in the anti-virus components, which would normally be downloaded from the web separately from the main console. These were clearly recognisable as many of the parts that make up the <em class="phrase">Sophos</em> product. </p><p> The interface is clear and simply laid out with the colourful style expected from home-user-focused anti-spyware offerings. Control of the various settings is available from several tabbed screens including those marked &lsquo;Shields&rsquo; and &lsquo;Options&rsquo;, although these were heavier on information than actual controls. </p><p> On-demand scans were run from a tab labelled &lsquo;sweep&rsquo;, and were straightforward to set up and run. Here again little deep configuration was available, but it proved sufficient for my needs, and judging by the slowish speeds achieved on demand, scanning appears to default to fairly thorough settings. </p><p> On-access scanning speeds were considerably faster, and among the most impressive in this month&rsquo;s set of products. This led me to suspect that settings here leaned towards the lax, ignoring many file types entirely. However, this proved not to be a problem where detection of the test sets was concerned. While, once again, blocking access completely did not seem to be possible, detection of malware as files were opened clearly took place, and thorough logs were produced. </p><p> The logs included useful data on the malware found, as well as warnings whenever scanning a file took longer than a few thousandths of a second. The logs also listed the vast majority of the samples in the sets, including everything rated In the Wild. With an impressive performance overall, congratulations go to <em class="phrase">Webroot</em> for claiming a VB100 award on its first attempt. </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Macro: </span></strong>99.93%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>100.00%</div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3701931"></a>Results tables</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2007/06/VB100-results-on-access0607.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2007/06/VB100-results-on-demand0607.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2007/06/VB100-results-throughput0607.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2007/06/VB100-results-access-lag0607.gif" /></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4481374"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div></div><p>It has been a mixed month for all comers, with the large number of new arrivals drawing attention away from the regulars, most of whom put in their usual strong performances without fuss. One particularly unfortunate piece of timing spoiled the records of a couple of products which are used to achieving the highest standards, while another suffered from a miscategorisation, but in general little of interest occurred regarding the old hands. </p><p> The newcomers tell an entirely different story, with a wide range of products showing a diverse selection of new ideas and implementations. </p><p> Some of the newcomers were virus scanners pure and simple, with perhaps some minor extra functionality which is becoming the norm in all products these days. Of these, several have developed their own scanning technology from scratch, and a select few have done well enough to pass the award criteria. </p><p> Most of the newcomers were a little lacking in detection of the samples included in the older test sets. Some of these older sets may be losing their relevance to modern users, and the process of modernising the <em class="citetitle">VB</em> test sets continues apace. However, the continued appearance of reports of <em class="productname">Windows 95</em> and even DOS malware from our prevalence data providers indicates that at least some users are still affected by these aging nasties, and would benefit from some protection from them. </p><p> The majority of the new products, though, were the result of specialist vendors from other security fields rolling virus protection into their offerings. Just as the traditional anti-virus vendors have had to expand their focus to include spyware protection and firewalls, so the firewall and anti-spyware experts have seen the need to add anti-virus protection to their products. This is generally done by licensing the detection technology of an established vendor, and in these cases implementation is all &ndash; with some integrating the engines into their products very successfully, and others still suffering a few teething problems. </p><p> Many of these products were highly impressive, and seem likely to offer some stiff competition to the established vendors with the diversity of extras they offer. As always, diversity and competition can only improve standards in general, but I hope that some of these ideas will be merged rather than further enlarging the field of products. It seems unlikely that either the poor exhausted test systems, or the equally worn out tester, could handle another month like this one.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4481377"></a>Technical details</h2></div></div></div><p><b>Test environment.&nbsp;</b>Test were run on identical machines with <em class="productname">AMD Athlon64 3800+ </em>dual core processors, 1GB RAM, 40GB and 200 GB dual hard disks, DVD/CD-ROM and 3.5-inch floppy drive, all running <em class="productname">Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2</em>.</p><p><b>Virus test sets.&nbsp;</b> Complete listings of the test sets used can be found at <a href="/uploads/old/comparatives/WinXP/2007/test_sets.html" target="_top">http://www.virusbtn.com/Comparatives/WinXP/2007/test_sets.html</a></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Any developers interested in submitting products for VB&#39;s comparative reviews should contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d1bbbeb9bfffb9b0a6b4a291a7b8a3a4a2b3a5bfffb2bebcff">[email&#160;protected]</a> The current schedule for the publication of VB comparative reviews can be found at <a href="/testing/vb100/vb100-test-schedule" target="_top">http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/about/schedule.xml</a>.</em></span></p></div> </div>
