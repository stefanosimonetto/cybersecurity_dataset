In December, 2012, we intercepted a professional-looking email that was impersonating Facebook Inc. in an attempt to trick its users into thinking that they’ve received an “Account Cancellation Request“. In reality, once users clicked on the links, their hosts were automatically exploited through outdated and already patched client-side vulnerabilities, which dropped malware on the affected PCs.
Over the past 24 hours, cybercriminals have resumed spamvertising tens of thousands of legitimate-looking Facebook themed emails, once again using the same social engineering theme.

Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

Malicious client-side exploitation URL chain: hxxp://mailstatic.twilightparadox.com -> hxxp://kidstoytowers.com/log/forums/index.php?showtopic=852510 -> hxxp://kidstoytowers.com/log/forums/rhin.jar -> hxxp://kidstoytowers.com/log/forums/Goo.jar -> hxxp://kidstoytowers.com/log/forums/lib.php -> hxxp://kidstoytowers.com/log/forums/load.php?showforum=lib
Sample client-side exploits served: CVE-2010-0188; CVE-2011-3544; CVE-2010-0840
Malicious domain name reconnaissance:
kidstoytowers.com – 62.75.181.220 – responding to the same IP is also the following domain – dailyfrontiernews.com
Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 9356fcd388b4bae53cad7aea4127d966 – detected by 3 out of 46 antivirus scanners as W32/Injector.YMS!tr.
Once executed, the sample sets the following Registry Keys to 1:
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZoneMap\ProxyBypass
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZoneMap\IntranetName
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionInternet SettingsZoneMap\UNCAsIntranet
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorerMountPoints2{a20cd692-8e41-11e1-9999-806d6172696f}\BaseClass
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsShellNoRoamMUICache(null)C:WINDOWSsystem32ipconfig.exe
It also (successfully) creates the following process:
C:d97f042474a0b1814fd681dca3ec2c5edf7054acff979f585a044478bc7c5cbd
If you catch a Facebook impersonating email in the wild, please forward it to phish@fb.com to notify Facebook of the attack. Webroot SecureAnywhere users are proactively protected from this threat.
