I Am Not Anti-Log

Some of you who rely on various system and application logs might take exception to my emphasis on interpreting network traffic.  You might think I am "anti-log."  That is absolutely not true.  I will demonstrate a case that shows I appreciate logs in certain situations.Last night I was analyzing alert data collected from one of the customers I monitor.  One of the Snort alerts I saw (a bleeding-exploit.rules entry) indicated BLEEDING-EDGE EXPLOIT Possible MSIE VML Exploit.  This did not look promising, especially since I was not flooded with these events.  In other words, if I had seen 100, I would not be 100 times more worried than if I saw only one alert.  The fact that I was investigating a single alert made me think this signature might be deadly accurate.I am not going to walk through the entire investigation for this event.  Suffice it to say I wanted to know if the victim system was truly exploited.  I eventually found myself looking at transcripts of traffic and the traffic itself.  I duplicated part of the activity on my own system so I could show you what that might look like without revealing client data.

No, I did not visit a dating site for fun.  Neither did my client.  Prior to this I saw nothing indicating those sorts of interests, so I'm guessing this was an unintentional case.The point is that it's much easier to understand a victim's Web browsing (if that's the crucial aspect of the investigation) if Web proxy logs are available, like these:1170223023.601    388 192.168.2.5 TCP_MISS/404 558 GET http://back88008800.com/ -  DIRECT/81.95.146.166 text/html1170223024.219    318 192.168.2.5 TCP_MISS/404 569 GET http://back88008800.com/favicon.ico - DIRECT/81.95.146.166 text/html1170223028.897    390 192.168.2.5 TCP_MISS/200 797 GET http://back88008800.com/dating.html - DIRECT/81.95.146.166 text/html1170223061.677    344 192.168.2.5 TCP_REFRESH_HIT/304 240 GET http://back88008800.com/dating.html - DIRECT/81.95.146.166 -1170223062.070    355 192.168.2.5 TCP_MISS/200 1946 GET http://back88008800.com/script.js - DIRECT/81.95.146.166 application/x-javascript1170223062.329    123 192.168.2.5 TCP_MISS/302 438 GET http://www.worlddatinghere.com/? - DIRECT/63.218.226.67 text/html1170223062.463    392 192.168.2.5 TCP_MISS/302 696 GET http://81.95.146.133/sutra/in.cgi? - DIRECT/81.95.146.133 text/html1170223062.802    339 192.168.2.5 TCP_MISS/200 4084 GET http://81.95.146.133/sp/sp2/index.php - DIRECT/81.95.146.133 text/htmlThese are my personal Squid Web cache logs, which tracked my investigation.  I like these logs because they cut right to the heart of the matter, namely what sites were visited as part of this event.While analyzing this case I also had access to session data, like this.

Session data is great because it shows me everything that happened, regardless of whether it involved a logging application (like a Web proxy) or not.  However, to get at the details I would need to generate transcripts, like this.

My point is that sometimes it's helpful to work with an application-specific log, like a Squid Web proxy log, instead of rebuilding everything from traffic.Speaking of Squid, I found that the default /etc/logrotate.d/squid entry which controls /var/log/access.log rotation, contains this:##       Logrotate fragment for squid.#/var/log/squid/*.log {        daily        compress        delaycompress        rotate 2        missingok        nocreate        sharedscripts        prerotate                test ! -x /usr/sbin/sarg-maint || /usr/sbin/sarg-maint        endscript        postrotate                test ! -e /var/run/squid.pid || /usr/sbin/squid -k rotate        endscript}I decided to change the "rotate 2" to "rotate 30" to give me 30 days of logs.  Remember this is my own network's setting, where I was duplicating my client's experience for your blog reading enjoyment.  As far as my client was concerned, I did not find any evidence of compromise after checking my session and full content data for suspicious post-alert activity.
