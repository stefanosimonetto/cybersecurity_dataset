Inspired by an old post, John Curry, and David Bianco's NSM Wiki, I decided I would install the Sguil client on Ubuntu.  It was really easy.  First I edited the /etc/apt/sources.list file to include the "universe" package collections: deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universe deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ edgy universeNext I updated the apt cache and added the libraries I needed.richard@neely:~$ sudo apt-get update...edited...richard@neely:~$ sudo apt-get install tclx8.4 tcllib iwidgets4 wiresharkReading package lists...

I was able to start Sguil and access servers.
