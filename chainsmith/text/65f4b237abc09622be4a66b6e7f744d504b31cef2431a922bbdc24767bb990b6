Network up2date

Continuing with our V7.5 release schedule, we have released the ISO images of V7.5 for all Astaro Gateway products. Next week on October 5th, we will distribute V7.5 as an Up2Date to all installations via our Content Distribution Network.

Also released are the SSI Images for the Astaro Smart Installer, a special USB drive which fully emulates the hardware of a USB CD-ROM in a portable form factor at full USB 2 speeds. If you frequently prepare your own hardware or image Astaro appliances, these are very handy to have! Note that you cannot use ASI Images to burn items to an everyday USB drive, you need an actual ASI for this. Read on for the ISO details.
