HMFT 0.3 + Extended Attributes, short update

update
fixed the title of the postÂ  â€“ itâ€™s obviously a version 0.3 and not 3.0 ðŸ™‚
old post
In my last post I talked about detecting Extended Attributes (used by ZeroAccess malware) using HMFT.Â  Today I got a chance to update it a bit with some more information.
First of all, I clustered some of the ZeroAccess samples I had and I came up with a list of comprehensive (of course itâ€™s limited by a sampleset I have) file locations and their Extended Attributes that are used by the malware:

%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\services.exe::731
%USERPROFILE%\appdata\local\a4ca9b9c\u::@@@
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\{0c9c4ca4-c3a9-47cf-2e3e-4db8bf2ad457}\U::001
%SYSTEMROOT%\$NtUninstallKB16214$\2764741532\U::CFG

You can find a full list of samples using EAs together with hashes (md5_sha1) here.
Secondly, I added some code to HMFT and now it can dump Extended Attributeâ€™s name (and some printable content of the EA value) as well:
RESIDENT ATTRIBUTE
AttributeTypeIdentifierD = 224
LengthOfAttributeDÂ Â Â Â Â Â  = 40
NonResidentFlagBÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  = 0
LengthOfNameBÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  = 0
OffsetToNameWÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  = 0
FlagsWÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  = 0
AttributeIdentifierWÂ Â Â Â  = 4
--
SizeOfContentDÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  = 16
OffsetToContentWÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  = 24
--
MFTA_EA
OfsNextEADÂ Â Â Â Â  = 16
FlagsBÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  = 0
EaNameLenBÂ Â Â Â Â  = 3
EaValueLenWÂ Â Â Â  = 3
EaName = FOO
EaValue= bar
Using newer version of HMFT on one of the ZeroAccess samples gives the following result after postprocessing with eads.pl script:

After HMFT update, eads.pl had to be slightly modified::
use strict;
my $f='';
my $l='';
while (<>)
{
s/[\r\n]+//g;
$f = $1 if /FileName = (.+)$/;
print "$f has $1 record\n" if ($l =~ /(MFTA_EA(_[A-Z]+)?)/);
print "$f:".":$1\n" if (/EaName = (.+)$/);
print "$f:$1\n" if ($l =~ /MFTA_DATA/&&/AttributeName = (.+)$/);
$l = $_;
}
Btw. if you look at the screenshot above you will notice :SummaryInformation ADS used by this sample (5D23ACF4C2221B687BC96A2701786C13/ AB7EEC68F9438E31523D0A67E7612CA666C8F56A) as well â€“ it can be even better seen in the window of Process Monitor during the malware installation:

In terms of APIs used by ZeroAccess to create EAs, I finally came across a few samples that use ZwSetEaFile to do so,. Interestingly. none of the samples used this API to create EA for services.exe â€“ all the samples using this API create the following EA:

%USERPROFILE%\appdata\local\a4ca9b9c\u::@@@
