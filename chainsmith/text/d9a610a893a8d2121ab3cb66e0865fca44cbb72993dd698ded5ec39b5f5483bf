Survey Scammers Bait Users with FIFA Coins
To all gamers and enthusiasts of FIFA 14: Please be wary of sites claiming to generate coins for you for nothing. As the saying goes—If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Recently, we found one such site: fifa14cheats(dot)cheathacktool(dot)com.

Once visited, it asks for an email address, and then, if provided, lets users decide on how many coins they want handed to them.

After users press “Finish Hack”, they are then presented with a survey scam that, as we may already know, will eventually lead to zero coins. There are still users who do not know this and had to find out the hard way unfortunately.
Surf smart, everyone!
