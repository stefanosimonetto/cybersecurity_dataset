Adware.cpush detection

Posted by Roger on 15 July 2007, 3:55 pm

I received what appears to be yet another false positive in Symantec Antivrius. Adware.cpush was detected in c:\program files\filezilla\uninstall.exe.
Filezilla is a ftp/sftp program from Mozilla. This has been on my computer for a while, so I tend to believe it is a false positive. I’ll update this thread if I see anything from Symantec on this subject.

Subject: LiveUpdate posting to correct False Positive
The July 16, 2007 LiveUpdate posting will correct a false positive detection
on some installers or tools created using the Nullsoft Scriptable Install
System (NSIS). This FP caused such files to be incorrectly detected as
Adware.CPush. This FP was first introduced in
RapidRelease definitions build number 70817 (version 07/14/2007 revision 32)
and in the 07/15/2007 revision 2 LiveUpdate and Intelligent Updater
definitions. It was corrected in RapidRelease definitions build number 70822
(version 07/15/2007 revision 4).
Today’s LiveUpdate and Intelligent Updater definitions will also correct
this FP. These definitions will have the version 07/16/2007 revision 21.
Current ETA for posting is 10:30AM PDT. An additional message will be sent
approximately 30 minutes before the LiveUpdate virus definitions are
available for download.
