Sample malicious URL spamvertised in the campaign: hxxp://blazewear.assetict.com/sgENCGn0/index.html
Upon clicking on the links, end and corporate users will view a “WAIT PLEASE, Loading…” page. In between, the campaign will attempt to load up to 4 different javascript files from multiple compromised URls in an attempt to serve client-side exploits and malware to users.

Structure of the client-side exploits serving process is as follows.
Malicious javascript loads from the followung URLs:
hxxp://apollprint.com/Dg9kxxHh/js.js
hxxp://bscert.eu/CAgADsB0/js.js
hxxp://chroniquesradios.com/7KnKEoKm/js.js
hxxp://frogeen.com/hPPP5CqE/js.js
Once the campaing loads the malicious javascript, the following redirections take place:
hxxp://blazewear.assetict.com/sgENCGn0/index.html
hxxp://apollprint.com/Dg9kxxHh/js.js
hxxp://jadecellular.com/showthread.php?t=73a07bcb51f4be71
hxxp://jadecellular.com/content/Qai.jar
The compromised legitimate web site participating in the campaign, has a very low detection rate.
Webroot’s security researchers will continue monitoring the spamvertised campaign, to ensure that Webroot SecureAnywhere customers are protected from this threat.
