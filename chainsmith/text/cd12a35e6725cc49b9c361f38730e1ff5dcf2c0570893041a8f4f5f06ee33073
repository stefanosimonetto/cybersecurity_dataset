In a recent survey of 1,100 enterprise IM users, IMlogic found that most respondents unwittingly expose their computers and the company’s infrastructures to malicious attacks because of IM’s social nature: users believe they are protected because they only exchange instant messages with people they trust. Some of the survey’s key findings include:
78 percent perceive IM to be safer than e-mail, and not subject any security threats or potential vulnerabilities;
63 percent would click on an unknown link because it came from someone on their buddy list, a perceived trusted source;
45 percent use IM at work because they believe their communication is unmonitored;
35 percent believe they have received a message containing a malicious link; and
29 percent regularly transfer files over IM.
