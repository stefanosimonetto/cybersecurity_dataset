This isn’t the first time that scammers have used theme park accidents as bait to get users to spread the scam for them. In June of this year, the bad guys were quick to jump in on the Alton Tower crash but they were found out by our researchers before their campaign fooled a lot users on Twitter who were closely following the news as events unfold.
Another report, such as the supposed accident at Universal Studios that led to multiple deaths, has also been debunked by experts.
In case you encounter news of disasters in your social network feeds in the future, we advise you to verify their truthfulness first before clicking something that may actually be a threat to your personal information and identity.
