" target="_top">VB, April 2009, p.15</a>) saw a record number of entries, with what seemed like an enormous 39 products taking part. This record was broken late last year with our first look at the gleaming new <em class="productname">Windows 7</em> platform when 43 products took part. As we came around to <em class="productname">XP</em> once more, we expected to see yet another new record set, but when the test deadline came, all expectations were exceeded by a seemingly endless flood of submissions arriving in the lab team&rsquo;s inboxes. With new arrangements made to allow the participation of products that require Internet access to install and acquire updates, even the simple task of acquiring the products for the test became a serious test of our time and resources. Network connections slowed to a crawl thanks to the multiple large downloads, and our storage capacity began to fill ominously. All test systems were in constant use as the less flexible solutions were installed, activated, updated and snapshots taken for testing.</p><p>In the end, a monster 60 products were accepted into the test, although we made it clear to vendors who submitted multiple entries that we would only be able to test them all if time allowed. With just a month to plough through all these products, it was clearly going to be a busy time, and after some trial runs in recent tests we had plans to add yet further to the selection of performance data being gathered. As soon as circumstances allowed, we buried ourselves in the lab with plenty of hot drinks and notepaper, preparing for the long haul. If you have a day or two to spare to read through this report, we hope you&rsquo;ll find some of our findings informative.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2121218"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p>Despite its now venerable age, the <em class="productname">XP</em> platform remains the most popular operating system on the planet, with most estimates agreeing that it runs on more than 50% of all computers worldwide. It is now, in a manner of speaking, a grandparent &ndash; succeeded by two newer generations of the <em class="productname">Windows</em> operating system &ndash; and is a full year into the &lsquo;extended support&rsquo; phase, with the plug finally due to be pulled in four years. It seems likely that large numbers of users will stick by it for much of that time, thanks to the stability and simplicity of use for which it has acquired such a strong reputation.</p><p>Running yet another test on the platform (our tenth so far, including 64-bit editions) required little effort in the set-up phases; test images from the last round were dug out, and a few adjustments made to fit in with changes to the lab network set-up, but no major work needed doing before fresh images were created. The systems were thus running bare <em class="productname">XP Professional SP3</em>, with no additional updates, and a handful of tools such as PDF viewers and archive tools, as per our standard operating procedure. With the unprecedented popularity of this comparative, a batch of new systems were also roped in for the test, with a near-identical environment installed on slightly more powerful hardware; these would be used for the donkey work of the big slow scans of the large test sets, while all performance-related tests would be run on the standard set of matching machines.</p><p>At the core of our performance tests are the speed sets, originally built by harvesting all files from a selection of <em class="productname">Windows</em> systems of varying degrees of lived-in-ness and dividing them by file type. These remain unchanged from the last several tests and although we hope to freshen them up in the near future, their content remains fairly reflective of normal ratios of different types of files. The content of these sets is deliberately made as common and widely used as possible, to minimize the possibility of false alarms, as the speed sets are counted as part of the false positive test. The system drive of the test machine is also considered part of the false positive test, although this should not cause any problems for any reasonably cautious product. Much of the testing using these sets is automated, and some adjustments were made to the automation scripts this month in order to gather further data from the test systems while the tests were being run; details of the methods used for this will be provided below.</p><p>The main bulk of our false positive test is labelled simply the &lsquo;clean set&rsquo;, and this saw some considerable expansion this month, with various new packages added including files harvested from a number of machines and CDs acquired by the lab team in recent months &ndash; a number of games and several sets of disk-burning utilities prominent among them. The set has also been pared down to exclude more obscure and insignificant items, and we plan to continue this process of tuning the set to reflect the more important items in future. For this month&rsquo;s test, the set contained close to half a million files.</p><p>Compiling the infected test sets has been considerably simplified of late by some improvements in automation. Ever larger numbers of new samples flood in from a growing range of sources, and are put through various types of checks and analyses before being considered for our test. These include static checking of file types and parameters, classification processes and dynamic analysis of behaviours. To save time in the tight comparative schedule, we tried to get as much of this work done as possible prior to building the sets, but as ever with the RAP sets being compiled well into the allotted time period many of these checks had to be left until testing was well under way. For this month&rsquo;s test, the four weekly RAP sets seemed somewhat more even than usual, with between 8,000 and 9,000 samples in each. The trojans set was built with samples gathered in the month or so between the end of the last RAP period and the start of this one, and a considerable expansion was made to our set of worms and bots, with samples from the same period adjudged to fit into this category added to the set. The polymorphic set saw only minimal adjustments, with a number of W32/Virut strains that had recently fallen off the WildList added to the set in expanded numbers.</p><p>The WildList set itself was aligned with the latest list available on the test set deadline of 20 February, which meant that the January list (released on 17 February) just made the cut. This list included the usual smattering of new samples, dominated by Autorun and Koobface worms and online gaming password stealers. What immediately stood out, however, was yet another strain of W32/Virut, which had appeared on the list since our last test. As always, large numbers of samples were replicated from the original control sample, each one checked to prove it capable of infecting other files, and the set was closed at a total of 2,500 Virut samples &ndash; which should be plenty to thoroughly exercise each product&rsquo;s capabilities at detecting this complex polymorphic virus in all its disguises. Also of note this month was the return of an old complex polymorphic threat, W32/Polip, which first appeared in mid-2006 and has remained in our polymorphic sets for some time. Again, some 2,500 samples were moved to the WildList set to represent this threat.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2162601"></a>Performance and resource usage measurements</h2></div></div></div><p>For some time now we have been including a variety of performance measurements along with the detection results in these comparatives; a few years ago we added on-access speed measurements to the on-demand throughput figures, and with such an epic test before us, now seemed the perfect moment to further add to our data.</p><p>Throughout this month&rsquo;s test, we planned to take a selection of measurements of the usage of system resources &ndash; such as RAM and CPU cycles &ndash; at various stages and to see what data could be harvested from them for presentation in these pages. In the final reckoning, with the publication deadline already disappearing behind us and much work still to do, it seemed sensible to pull as much of this data together as possible into a simple and easy-to-read format. To this end we have focused on two simple measures: the total available memory and the percentage of CPU cycles in use, and split them into two types of measurement &ndash; with the system idle, and during heavy file accessing activity. The latter measures were all taken during our standard on-access tests, and while the data could possibly be split into different sets and so on for greater granularity, it seemed preferable to keep things simple.</p><p>The measures were taken using the <em class="productname">Windows Performance Monitor</em> via a command-line tool run as part of the normal test scripts. Figures for the RAM and CPU usage were taken every 15 seconds during the on-access speed tests while files from the speed sets and the system drive were being accessed by our opener tool, and their MD5 checksums taken. These figures were trimmed of the highest and lowest ten per cent to minimize anomalous data, and then averaged. Idle times were taken from several five-minute periods left alone throughout the course of each product&rsquo;s test period, again with snapshots every 15 seconds, trimmed and averaged, and both sets of figures were compared with baselines generated on identical systems with no security software present.</p><p>The final figures were calculated as the percentage increase from the baseline measures to the figures taken with each product installed and running. This should give some indication of the impact of the product on the system, although there are, of course, a number of provisos. The figures should not be taken as a definitive indicator of relative performance during all computing activities &ndash; these initial measures are something of a trial, for now presenting purely academic information on fairly unnatural behaviour. We hope in future to introduce a series of such measures taken during more generally applicable activities, to provide a more complete and accurate benchmark of variations in performance between products. As always, we aim to continue to improve and expand the value of our tests.</p><p>Speaking of which, let&rsquo;s start looking at those products.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3244123"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4310896"></a>Agnitum Outpost Security Suite Pro 6.5.2514.0685</h3></div></div></div><p>First on the test bench this month was <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Outpost</em> suite. This was provided, with the latest updates included, as a single executable which surprised us by being a mere 51MB. Some initial problems soon revealed that this was not the full package, and a retry at downloading gleaned a much more substantial 86MB file. The installation process involved quite a number of steps, most of which related to setting up the firewall component. In all, it took around three minutes to complete and a reboot was required to finalize the installation.</p><p>The interface is clear and businesslike, with much of the focus on the firewall and intrusion-prevention components. A small amount of space in the configuration section is dedicated to the anti-malware settings, and provides some basic controls which proved ample for our requirements. The test ran through smoothly with no notable issues, apart from an interesting &lsquo;training mode&rsquo; pop-up requesting permission for our file-opening utility to run.</p><p>Scanning speeds were fairly good on demand &ndash; initially somewhat slow thanks to the thorough default settings, but improving notably in the &lsquo;warm&rsquo; scans, once files had become familiar. In our new performance measures, it seemed fairly light on both CPU and RAM usage, especially given the complexity of the product.</p><p>In the detection tests, after the initial false start we soon gathered some useful logs, which showed solid coverage across the standard sets and a good coverage of the reactive part of the RAP test, with a sharp drop in the proactive week. The core components of the certification sets were handled without problems though, and <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em> takes the first of what promises to be a record batch of VB100 awards earned this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/04/Agnitum-RAP-Apr10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>89.39%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>97.96%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>89.11%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4937302"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2779178"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4478042"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2213084"></a>AhnLab V3 Internet Security 8.0.26</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> also provided its product with updates rolled in, with the installer executable measuring around 81MB. The set-up process was pretty speedy, with only a few &lsquo;next&rsquo; clicks and it was all done in under a minute, with no reboot required. The product interface is simple and clean, with professional-looking configuration panels for the pickier user, and it all seems to run quite sensibly. The only confusing aspect is the division of detections into malware and spyware, with separate logging and treatment of each; this resulted in occasional moments of confusion when items appeared not to have been detected but in fact the detections had simply been logged in a different place.</p><p>From there on the test ran smoothly without interruption. On-demand scanning speeds seemed fairly middle-of-the-road, with no caching of results to enhance speed. On access things were much better, with some very light lag times, and the new performance figures showed a similar dichotomy, with pretty low RAM drain but much more standard impact on CPU cycles.</p><p>Detection results were a little below par in the trojans and RAP sets, but pretty decent in the polymorphic and worms and bots sets; the WildList was handled with no problems, and with no false alarms in the clean sets <em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> earns a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/04/AhnLab-RAP-Apr10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>51.78%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>91.75%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.59%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2547643"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3854534"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2547806"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2223395"></a>Alwil avast! free antivirus 100224-1</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Alwil</em>&rsquo;s thoroughly refreshed version of avast! was enthusiastically reviewed in these pages a few months ago (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2010/01/alwil-avast-5
" target="_top">VB, January 2010, p.17</a>), and we looked forward to seeing it back on the test bench. The company opted to enter only its free version for this test, having included both the free and professional editions in the recent <em class="productname">Windows 7 </em>comparative. The product was provided with the latest updates in a compact 41MB executable, and installed in remarkable time. Only two steps were involved &ndash; one of these offered to install the <em class="productname">Google Chrome</em> browser for greater security online, while the other recommended users contribute to a community data-collection scheme. No reboot was required, and everything was happily up and running in seconds.</p><p>The new GUI remains extremely impressive both in its clear functionality and its sheer beauty. It ran fast and nimbly, with excellent responsiveness and rock-solid stability. While the new performance stats showed fairly notable increases in both RAM and CPU usage, the scanning speeds and on-access throughput measures were excellent, especially the &lsquo;warm&rsquo; times, making for some splendid figures.</p><p>Detection rates were also extremely impressive across the board, with only a rather steep decline in the RAP &lsquo;week +1&rsquo; set worthy of note; no issues were observed in the clean sets or the WildList, and the free version of <em class="productname">avast!</em> is a worthy winner of a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/04/Alwil-RAP-Apr10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>98.33%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.46%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>93.28%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3207304"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3914200"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4058880"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3321942"></a>Arcabit ArcaVir 2010 10.2.3204.4</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Arcabit</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">ArcaVir</em> also comes pre-updated, as a 90MB executable. The first action on launching is to offer the choice of Polish or English language, reflecting the product&rsquo;s home market. Having made a selection, nothing seemed to happen for almost a minute while it prepared itself, and then the full installation process began. This went through the standard handful of steps before setting about its business. The process seemed to run swiftly but lingered again &ndash; while claiming to have &lsquo;0 seconds&rsquo; remaining &ndash; for almost two minutes. When it eventually finished, a reboot was demanded, and the whole process took four or five minutes in all. On some occasions we had some problems with the install completing, seeing errors regarding a &lsquo;configurator&rsquo; module, and indeed on these occasions we noted some rather bizarre and unpredictable behaviour with little relation to the settings advertised in the interface.</p><p>The GUI itself is bright and colourful and seems fairly clearly laid out; it offers basic and advanced modes, with the latter most suitable for our requirements. It provided most of what we needed to get our work done fairly readily, and lumbered through the tests quite steadily. Some oddities were observed measuring the depth of archive scanning, when it seemed that enabling archive handling on access actually reduced the depth to which self-extracting zip files were scanned (while switching on most other types to a reasonable depth).</p><p>In the performance tests, CPU and RAM usage were not too extreme, and on-access lag times pretty light, while on-demand throughput was fairly average. In the infected sets however, several W32/Virut samples seemed to trip it up, causing the product to hang rather badly. We eventually managed to nurse it through the tests by removing samples as they caused problems. An updated DLL file was provided by the developers to demonstrate that the product had been fixed, and this seemed to render it much more stable, so the issue seems to have been a temporary one that existed around the time of the product submission date. The scan of the large clean set proved problematic too, as it seemed to run for some time but then simply vanished as soon as there were no eyes on the screen, providing no evidence that it had completed. Eventually a full run through the set was managed using only the on-access component.</p><p>Detection rates recorded here may not be entirely accurate thanks to the numerous files which were moved aside to ensure the product made it to the ends of the various scans, but it achieved some reasonable figures. Given the large number of crashes and the need to remove several Virut samples it would have been difficult to justify granting a VB100 award, but there was no need to worry about whether to make any exceptions to our usual rules as it was observed that the product had missed a single file in the WildList set on access, thanks to an incomplete set of extensions being scanned. It also alerted incorrectly on several files in the clean sets. <em class="productname">ArcaVir</em> thus does not reach the required standard for a VB100 award this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/04/Arcabit-RAP-Apr10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.86%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>51.12%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>85.47%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>79.03%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>6</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3986713"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4875435"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3646195"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2476347"></a>Authentium Command Anti-Malware 5.1.1</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Authentium</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Command</em> product comes as a minimalist 12MB installer executable. It is provided with a special manual updating scheme for our purposes, involving an additional 22MB cab file containing the definitions. Without this extra stage, the actual set-up is extremely fast and simple, with just a couple of steps including applying a licence key; no reboot is needed and the product is providing protection within a minute.</p><p>The interface is equally simple and unfussy, with a limited selection of options but providing some sensible defaults and a few useful extras.

The company&rsquo;s foray into anti-malware is named <em class="productname">Double Anti-Spy</em> and boasts a dual-engine approach using technology from <em class="phrase">Sunbelt</em> and <em class="phrase">Agnitum</em> as the twin prongs of its defensive fork. With this approach the installer is necessarily large &ndash; at 194MB without even the latest updates. The installation process is fast, slick and professional, with only online updates available. Application of an activation key and a reboot were included in the process.</p><p>The interface is fairly simple, bulbous and colourful, with a fairly basic level of configuration &ndash; much of the layout is reminiscent of <em class="phrase">Sunbelt</em> products. Running through the initial stages of the test seemed fairly straightforward, with the product operating properly and responding well to intervention. Both RAM and CPU usage were understandably heavy, and on-demand scans were long and slow, but file access lags were pretty light once the product had seen and recognized clean items.</p><p>When we got to the detection tests things got a little more tricky. Initial runs through the infected sets not only took a long time, thanks to the in-series approach of the twin engines, but were also prone to crashes, with error messages warning of services failing. Eventually, after much gentle nurturing, we managed to complete a full set of runs through the main test set, and an equally troublesome run through the RAP set showed some decent scores. On access, things were far worse, with crashes occurring repeatedly despite slowing down the file-accessing tools. After a cascade of crashes the system became barely responsive, but usually came back to life after a fairly aggressively imposed reboot. In the end we recorded some good scores in the trojans set and nothing missed in the WildList. However, a single false alarm occurred in the clean sets, and with no on-access scores at all it was not possible to award <em class="phrase">Avanquest</em> a VB100 for this performance.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/04/Avanquest-RAP-Apr10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>96.23%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.11%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>65.32%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>1</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2815236"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2815244"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2880878"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3751646"></a>AVG Internet Security Network Edition 9.0.733</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AVG</em>&rsquo;s suite solution remains unchanged from several tests in the past year or so. With its many components the installer comes in at a fairly sizeable 110MB, with all updates and an activation key included for us in the pre-prepared submission. The installation process runs through only a handful of steps, and completes in a couple of minutes with no need to reboot, but at the end it insists on an &lsquo;optimization&rsquo; scan to check the machine and get itself settled in. This didn&rsquo;t take long though, and we were soon moving along nicely.</p><p>The GUI is a little cluttered with all the different suite components, many of which seem to overlap somewhat. However, we found the advanced configuration pleasingly clear with all the required options kept together in one place, which made for easy manipulation.</p><p>On-demand scanning speeds were pretty sluggish, and access lag times fairly hefty too, while memory and processor usage was high, but did not challenge the biggest drainers on the charts.</p><p>Detection rates were fairly decent across the test sets &ndash; a little behind the front-runners in the RAP table perhaps, but still highly commendable.

The product as provided was a fair size, with a 114MB main installer and an additional 49MB of updates, to cover the numerous component parts included (of which anti-malware protection is just one). The install process has a fair number of steps, thanks again to the multiple components and the need for an activation key, but doesn&rsquo;t need a reboot to complete and is all done in about three minutes. The interface is fairly clear and simple to navigate, but on-access protection appears not to take effect on-read, and instead tests were run by writing sample files to the system.</p><p>Tests proceeded without major incident, although they took some time as on-demand scans were slow, even over the clean set &ndash; this is mainly due to the use of the <em class="productname">Norman Sandbox</em> to thoroughly check unrecognized files. On-access measures look extremely light, but as there was no true on-read protection in place this is an unfair comparison with others in the test; increase in memory usage was still fairly noticeable.</p><p>Detection rates were generally pretty decent, but in the WildList set imperfect coverage of the latest W32/Virut strain was evident, with the sandbox improving things somewhat on-demand. In the clean sets there were also a handful of samples misidentified as malware, and so <em class="productname">Blink</em> is denied a VB100 award this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/04/eEye-RAP-Apr10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>99.99%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>99.99%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>76.63%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>94.52%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>83.47%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>3</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4494331"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3767483"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4393255"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2885776"></a>Emsisoft a-squared Anti-Malware 5.0.0.31</h3></div></div></div><p>Yet another new arrival, and one which has been anticipated for some time thanks to an excellent reputation for high detection rates, <em class="phrase">Emsisoft</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">a-squared</em> incorporates the <em class="phrase">Ikarus</em> engine along with some improvements of its own. The installer package is a 75MB executable, and online updating was insisted on by the vendor. The install process took only a few moments, but it took a while longer to get things up and running thanks to the online activation and updating process.</p><p>Once installed, we found the product very attractive, with a crisp and colourful GUI adorned with a delightful rotating golden Trojan horse. There appeared to be a decent range of configuration options provided, in a pleasant and accessible manner. On investigating further, however, we found that the on-access component was unresponsive to various stimuli; this remained the case despite various efforts &ndash; restarting the module and the test systems, installing afresh and so on. The version of the product in use, with full on-read protection included, is at an early stage of beta, so such problems are to be expected, but we were disappointed not to be able to test the product fully. A quick investigation of more recent releases &ndash; produced a week or two after the test deadline &ndash; showed that the issues had been resolved and a much more rugged, stable on-access component was being provided even to beta users.</p><p>Without the on-access component there seemed to be little point running the full range of performance tests, but the on-demand scan times were fairly middle-of-the-road. Running through the detection tests, we had some further issues as the product seems to maintain all detection data in memory until a scan is complete, rather than writing out to a log as it goes, so on attempting large scans with lots of data to store it had a tendency to collapse under the pressure. Fortunately, a command-line scanner is also provided, and this proved much more stable. With some data finally in, some truly superb results were observed, with all sets completely demolished, the RAPs especially looking set for a top-of-the-table score. Sadly, in the WildList set a batch of Virut samples were not detected &ndash; which would have been enough to deny <em class="phrase">Emsisoft</em> a VB100 award even had its on-access component been fully operational &ndash; and a single false alert in the clean sets also denies it the chance to take up a prime position on our aggregate RAP charts.

The company&rsquo;s current flagship product, <em class="productname">System Mechanic</em>, is widely sold in high street outlets and has had some great reviews for its clean-up and optimization components.</p><p>The product was provided as a 64MB installer, requiring Internet connection to update, so it was set up on the deadline day and an image of the test machine taken for later testing. The installation process is rather lengthy, including numerous prompts related to the many components, and required a reboot to complete. The interface is very professional looking, running stably and responsively throughout our tests despite some seriously intense pressure. Little configuration is provided for the anti-malware component, with so many other modules to cover in a single GUI, but the defaults are sensible and it all seems to work nicely.</p><p>In the speed tests, on-demand scans were not the fastest, with some fairly notable slowing down in the file access times and a sizeable chunk of memory used up. Although the logs were difficult to convert from a rather odd format into more usable text, we got results in the end and detection was found to be generally pretty good throughout, declining fairly sharply across the RAP sets. Comparing these numbers with others already recorded and perusing the titles of the installation folders gave away the secret of the provider of the core anti-malware components: <em class="phrase">Authentium</em>. Unfortunately, this meant the same false positive which upset <em class="phrase">Authentium</em>&rsquo;s chances came into play again here, and iolo doesn&rsquo;t quite meet the VB100 requirements this month. However, a solid performance hints at much better things to come.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/04/iolo-RAP-Apr10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>83.23%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>96.38%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.85%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>1</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3240556"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3240564"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4629301"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4310298"></a>K7 Total Security 10.0.00.29</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">K7</em> has become a regular fixture in our tests over the last few years, steadily building a solid reputation and considerable respect from the lab team for simple, solid performances.

This is supplied as a 68MB executable, with updates provided as an archived copy of the online databases (the archive measuring a hefty 360MB). The installation process runs through several stages, including a request for a licence code. Although licence files were supplied, there was no obvious way to load them in, and the product seemed averse to accepting any codes typed in, so we proceeded with a trial version only. No restart was required to get protection in place.</p><p>The green-and-red-heavy interface is big on clarity, with large fonts and simple phrasing making for simple and error-free navigation. Beneath the novice-friendly veneer, configuration is provided in enough depth to satisfy the most demanding of power users. This made running through the tests something of a breeze, with scanning speeds only average at first but benefiting hugely from some intelligent caching on subsequent runs. On-access overheads were similarly unobtrusive, while memory usage was perhaps a little above average but CPU cycle impact fairly low.</p><p>In the infected sets, detection rates came in even better than we had expected, with excellent figures across all sets. A remarkable steadiness in the reactive portion of the RAP sets supports the company&rsquo;s reputation for rapid reaction to newly emerging threats.

After being impressed by the product in a standalone review some time ago (see <a href="/virusbulletin/2008/09/lavasoft-ad-aware-2008
" target="_top">VB, September 2008, p.14</a>), we&rsquo;ve been waiting for on-read detection to be enabled before it could be pushed through our tests, and were excited to see it finally arrive on the test bench. The installer was a fairly sizeable 151MB, and ran through in not too many steps, one of which was the offer of a toolbar, taking a minute or so in total and needing a reboot to finish off. After restarting, the system seemed to take some time to come to.</p><p>The interface is fairly simplistic, with access to controls a little confusing and, when found, not very detailed. Nevertheless, running through the standard performance tests was not a problem, with some fairly good throughput times and pretty light on-access overheads &ndash; although memory usage was perhaps a little on the high side.</p><p>In the infected sets things were a little less straightforward. Initial runs through the test sets failed numerous times, with the scans &ndash; and on occasion the entire system &ndash; coming to a grinding halt. Part of the cause of this seemed to be the approach to scanning, which insists on storing all detection data in memory and not writing anything out to logs until after actions have been applied to detected items. This meant that after running scans over large-ish infected sets &ndash; which took a few hours even on trimmed down portions of the standard test sets &ndash; we had to wait for the disinfection and removal process to complete before any data could be gathered. As this could take up to ten times as long as the scan itself, it left much more opportunity for problems to emerge, and as the memory usage built steadily, errors cropped up regularly &ndash; at one point the main process tried to absorb 2GB of memory before collapsing under its own weight. Similar problems emerged during the on-access tests too, but eventually, by splitting the sets into smaller and smaller chunks and re-running tests until they ran through to completion, we managed to gather some usable figures. Of course, this kind of scenario would be unlikely (although not impossible) in the real world, but we do expect products to be fairly resilient when under pressure.</p><p>In the final reckoning, some pretty decent detection scores were achieved, especially in the RAP sets, with the numbers as well as the stability issues hinting at a change of engine provider since we last looked at the product. In the WildList however, a pair of items were not picked up on access, thanks to a fairly common file extension being missed from the list of types to scan by default.

The company has recently started submitting its consumer product lines as well as its corporate offerings, and these have caused us a few minor difficulties thanks to the apparent absence of any facility for installing or updating without web access, but having made special provisions for such products this was less of a hassle than usual this month. The original installer downloaded from the company&rsquo;s website measures only 2.8MB, and when run pulls the remainder of the product down, with over 100MB coming through in the initial run; the process is fairly simple and idiot-proof, taking at most a few minutes to get everything done with no reboot needed at the end.</p><p>The interface of this version is slightly different from the others we&rsquo;ve looked at lately, and seems to buck the trend towards colourfulness and curvy lines in consumer products. This one is grey, bleak and boxy, rather bewildering to navigate, at times slow to respond and provides minimal configuration options, but behind the brittle exterior it seems to run smoothly and solidly with not a whisper of stability problems.</p><p>On-demand scans were good and fast, while file access lags were a little slower than some, and memory and CPU usage seemed light.

Installation completes in under a minute before insisting on a reboot to finish things off.</p><p>Once installed, and guided by some instructions from the developers where characters were not properly displayed, we soon found our way around those bits of the GUI we needed access to, but detailed configuration was a little beyond the scope of our investigations.

The current product comes as a 65MB installer, including all updates, and runs through in half a dozen steps which include firewall details and information on the experience level of the user. At the end, a message indicates that a reboot may be required shortly, and sure enough after another minute or so it does indeed ask the user to restart the system.</p><p>The interface is browser-based and looks competent and serious. It is fairly easy to navigate and provides a basic selection of configuration options, but in some areas it seemed a little baffling &ndash; having gone to the trouble of setting up some on-demand scan jobs using the task editor utility, there appeared to be no way to fire them off. We could have missed something of course, but being in something of a hurry we resorted to using the context-menu scanner instead. One other eccentricity about the product is the provision of a screensaver scanner, which runs when the computer is not in use.</p><p>Ploughing through the speed tests took some time, in part thanks to the sandbox system which carefully checked out unknown files in the clean sets; this would have benefited from some caching of previous results to speed things up on re-runs.

Nevertheless, logs were kept of detections and results calculated from those.</p><p>The non-standard approach to on-access protection may have resulted in some less than accurate performance records, which seem to show an extremely light impact on the system; on-demand scans, by contrast, were rather slow.

The company&rsquo;s 2010 product, provided as a 74MB installer, started slowly with a rather lengthy set-up process, multiple dialogs to respond to and a reboot required.</p><p>Running through the tests was helped by a slick and attractive interface that also managed to pack in plenty of configuration without hampering easy navigation; the dancing lion in the corner of the screen was perhaps less useful. Speed tests seemed to pass without incident, recording some sluggish on-demand times and some hefty lags on access, although RAM usage was impressively low.</p><p>The detection tests were a rockier ride, with excitement aplenty; the heavy strain of the test sets did some odd things to the system, including some nasty mangling of the window manager which took some time to recover from. The on-access scanner appeared to shut down on occasion too; it was not clear whether this was caused by a particularly problematic file or by general exhaustion from the strain, but most of the main sets were managed without too much difficulty and the trojans set was eventually run to completion thanks to hard work, numerous small runs and removal of any files which seemed to be causing difficulties. On-demand scans ran a little more smoothly, although there was still a hefty impact on the system, and the logs produced at the end were pretty awkward for a human to interpret (a button is provided in the GUI to export them, but this seemed permanently greyed out).</p><p>Eventually we had all the information we needed in a usable form, and it showed some respectable figures in some sets, with the RAP scores perhaps a little disappointing and the trojan set scores hampered by the issues getting complete scans to run.

With such a huge selection of products there are of course many notable trends and developments to comment on, but with so much already said I&rsquo;ll limit myself to the most vital and obvious.</p><p>The first thing that springs to mind looking over these results is the continuing trend for the relicensing of engines by OEM product makers, and the gradual climb to dominance of certain players in these markets. Of the 60 products in this month&rsquo;s test, nine were underpinned by the same engine, while another engine provided the technology for four and another for three more. This trend presents some interesting points as we look to move our testing towards more labour- and time-intensive real-world methodologies, where the number of products that can be tested will be limited by the available resources. It seems vital that we continue to provide VB100 testing for this wealth of products, to ensure the public have a trustworthy source of information on their performance levels, but it also seems that the level of detail currently included could be trimmed somewhat, to allow us to carry out other duties.</p><p>A lot of the burden this month has been imposed by difficult and recalcitrant products. <em class="productname">Windows XP</em> is a mature and common platform, so we assume that products will support it solidly and without difficulty. However, this month&rsquo;s test has seen quite scandalous levels of instability, crashing, hanging, errors and shutdowns, failure to bear up under even the slightest strain and, in two separate cases, complete failure to provide any on-access protection at all. In this day and age users expect and deserve better; many of the companies here this month would do well to give their QA processes a thorough overhaul before doing anything else.</p><p>Of course, there have also been the usual problems with failure to detect WildList samples and with false positives in the clean set. This month&rsquo;s haul of FPs has included some fairly glaring examples, including several versions of <em class="phrase">Adobe</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Reader</em> &ndash; one of the most common pieces of non-<em class="phrase">Microsoft</em> software on the planet &ndash; as well as samples from <em class="phrase">Microsoft</em> itself and other major providers including <em class="phrase">Google</em> and <em class="phrase">Sun</em>. In the race to expand detection by ever more aggressive heuristics, vendors must strive to balance their detections with the false alarm rate, and in some cases this balance is not quite being maintained.</p><p>In the WildList, the deadly Virut once again took its casualties. These complex polymorphic viruses are proving challenging for labs to detect fully and accurately &ndash; which is exactly as their makers intended. Hopefully with our help and encouragement we can make a contribution to improving things on this score &ndash; all vendors with issues should already have been provided with samples and information, and we will continue to work with them to ensure any problems are fully rectified.</p><p>And now our work here is almost done. We look forward to a rather quieter comparative next time around.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4799753"></a>Technical details</h2></div></div></div><p><b>Test environment.&nbsp;</b>All performance tests were run on identical systems with <em class="productname">AMD Athlon64 X2</em> Dual Core 5200+ processors, 2GB RAM, dual 80GB and 400GB hard drives, running <em class="productname">Microsoft Windows XP Professional, Service Pack 3</em>.

The clean sets consist of our speed sets &ndash; compiled by harvesting all files from a selection of machines and organizing them by file type &ndash; plus a large set of known-good files from a broad selection of sources including magazine cover CDs, popular download sites, pre-installed OEM machines, hardware manufacturers&rsquo; driver and update sites and others. We try to ensure that the test set is reasonably representative of the real world without penalizing products for what might be considered minor infractions, unlikely to inconvenience most users. We endeavour to select samples of files that are likely to have a significant user base, excluding more obscure and uncommon packages. We also try to exclude packages that make use of unsavoury activities such as harvesting user data without adequate permission, and also avoid most security-related software, in particular anti-malware software.</p><p>Currently, the process of assigning a significance value to non-malicious software is more of an art than a science. While the user-base of some types of software can be divined from download statistics on popular freeware sites, such data is not freely available for all types of file. Likewise, measuring the impact on the user of a false positive is not trivial. We have been investigating various methods of classifying files on both these scales for some time, and with some work being done by the AMTSO group on exactly these issues, we hope to be able to introduce a more clearly documented selection process for our clean sets in the near future.</p><p>The WildList test set is compiled on much more rigid grounds; each item on the monthly lists produced by the <em class="phrase">WildList Organization</em> is represented by a single control sample, carefully vetted and confirmed by the list&rsquo;s operators, and each of these control samples is separately validated and replicated by our own lab staff. In most cases the malware replicates either on or off the local system, producing a file that is identical to the control sample. In such cases the replicated file alone is used as our representative sample. However, in some cases, multiple file extensions may be used by a single item (for example, filling a shared folder with several copies of the same file, but using various different filenames intended to lure people into opening them, with different extensions used to conceal the files&rsquo; purpose and potential). In such cases several copies of the sample are added to our test set, including each extension it is seen using. Additional files &ndash; such as dropped or downloaded files or loader files required to launch a control sample &ndash; are not included in the core set. In the case of file infectors, the original control sample is used to create replicants, infecting a range of &lsquo;goat&rsquo; files; for polymorphic samples, this is done many times, with a limit of 2,500 representative samples of any given virus strain included in the official set; the original control sample is not used. When completed, the set should contain only samples which can cause an infection exactly as the control samples would cause.</p><p>The WildList is due for some updating to include a wider range of sample types very soon. When this expansion comes into play, we expect to adjust our replication process to focus simply on validation, as most samples in any such list will have no internal replication mechanisms; we also expect the list to provide an even tougher challenge to product developers than it already does.</p><p>The VB100 certification requirements demand that products detect the entire WildList set, both on demand and on access, without generating any false positives in the clean set. A certified product is simply one which has met these requirements; it does not imply that the product is superb if it has passed a single certification run, or that it is useless if it has failed to meet the requirements in a single run. On its own, a single VB100 pass can only show that a product is legitimate and competently put together; that its makers know what they are doing and have good access to the most common samples likely to affect their users. For a more complete picture of the quality of a product, our readers need to look at several reviews and monitor the performance of products over time to get an idea of the consistency and reliability of a solution. For this reason, we provide detailed archive data of all our tests on our website, along with summary information on each product&rsquo;s performance history (see <a href="/vb100/archive/" target="_top">http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/</a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3821441"></a>Additional data</h3></div></div></div><p>To support this insight into quality as well as competence, each comparative review provides a range of information to complement the basics of the certification scheme. These extras include detection rates over our polymorphic, worms and bots, and trojans test sets and products&rsquo; RAP scores. The RAP scores are based on detection rates for four sets of samples compiled over the three weeks prior to a test deadline and one week after product submission, thus giving an idea of products&rsquo; reactive and proactive detection abilities. The samples used in the RAP sets come from our daily feeds from various sources including malware labs from around the world and other independent collections, and exclude adware and &lsquo;potentially unwanted&rsquo; items. They also currently exclude true viruses due to time constraints in performing proper replication of such samples. As part of the set-building process, we try to classify samples and select those with the greatest prevalence. This classification is currently based on our prevalence data, which is compiled from reports provided by a number of bodies including several major security firms as well as independent groups and government organizations.</p><p>Most of our main test sets are performed both on demand and on access. The on-demand tests for all our sets are run where possible as a standard scan from the product interface. Where the interface does not provide the option of scanning a single folder, a context-menu (&lsquo;right-click&rsquo;) scan is substituted. This scan is performed with the default settings; the only adjustments made are to ensure that full and detailed logging is kept, and where possible to disable the automatic cleaning, deletion or quarantining of detected items. For on-access tests, an opener tool is run over the set performing simple file-open actions, and taking the MD5 checksum of the file if permitted to access it. For products which do not check files on-read, files are copied from one drive of the machine, or from a remote system, to the system partition to measure on-write detection. Again, default settings are used as far as possible, with logging and auto-cleaning the only areas adjusted. The RAP and main clean sets are generally only scanned on demand, under the assumption that, in general, on-demand scanners use more thorough defaults than on-access ones and any detection or false alarms made on access would also appear on demand. When products cannot be made to produce adequate logs on demand, or otherwise fail to satisfy our requirements in this way, on-access runs over these sets may be substituted.</p><p>The same methods are applied to the performance tests, most of which are run from DOS batch scripts which control the file-accessing tools and performance monitors used to gather information for our charts and graphs.</p><p>Of course, all of this only scratches the surface as far as modern security solutions are concerned, with a wide range of technologies remaining untouched by these methodologies. We continue to investigate ways of expanding our testing to include a full range of techniques including live online resources and dynamic monitoring. However, we have no doubt that simplified tests of core functionality such as provided here &ndash; covering a wide range of solutions and a broad depth of threats &ndash; will continue to be useful to ensure the legitimate can be discerned from the devious, the rogues from those of good pedigree.</p></div></div> </div>
