Network up2date

This development snapshot of upcoming ASG V7 shows the latest state of ASG V7 BETA. Besides a lot of fixes and beautification it includes also the promised Initial Install Wizard.

The persistent feedback on our UBB and on V7Beta@astaro.com motivated us to release another snapshot of upcoming ASG V7: 6.933 Because of the amount of changes we are not able to provide a Firmware Up2Date package, but you can use your backup file from a previous ASG V7 BETA installation. Please remember: it’s still not the GA version of ASG V7. It will not be supported via Astaro’s support teams therefore you should not use it within productive environments! Now everything is in (Initial Setup Wizard, Overall Reporting / Executive Report, NTLM Single Sign On) and the last missing part is a new ACC version to support ASG V7 fully.
