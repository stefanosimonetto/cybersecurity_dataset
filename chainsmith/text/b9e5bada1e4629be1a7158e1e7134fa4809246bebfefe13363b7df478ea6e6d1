Known issues note regarding Virtualization:
There is a small problem which leads to deadlocks during boot-up on some versions of the KVM virtualization if the KVM instance uses more than one CPU. The workaround is to only use this version in KVM instances with one CPU.
The ISO installer sometimes hangs on start-up when using Citrix XEN. The workaround is to install 9.006 and use the Up2Date to 9.100 to run this version.
Up2Date Installation: Sophos Up2Date technology makes it easy to upgrade your Sophos UTM to the latest version. There are two ways to apply an already-downloaded Up2Date package to the system:

Log on to WebAdmin, navigate to Management >> Up2Date >> Overview and use Update to latest version now to install the Firmware Up2Date. Click on the “Watch Up2Date Progress in new window” and an extra browser window will show the progress of the Up2Date installation. (The System administrator will receive a notification email once the Up2Date process has finished.)
Download the Up2Date package from our HTTP or FTP Server and install it under Management >> Up2Date >> Advanced:
