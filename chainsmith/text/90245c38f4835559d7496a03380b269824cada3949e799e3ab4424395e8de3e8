Offline patching

You don’t always have the ability to download patches, perhaps the system only has dialup access to the internet.
There are a couple of ways to deal with this.

I’d be a bit concerned about whether this method is all right with Microsoft and whether anyone is sneaking something into the offline patch collection. Autopatcher has been around for a while, so I’d trust it more. The Heise-Security Offline Update is new to me.
