**Important Licensing Note**: Version 3 now uses our  the newer-style licensing model we released in 2010 for our  ASG products. This means your existing ACC key  from the MyAstaro portal  is longer valid, nor is any outstanding static  keys from the time when  we only offered a single key for all  installations. To get your new  ACC 3.0 key, fill out the creation form on our website. Your personalized license will then be available via the License Management section of your MyAstaro account.
