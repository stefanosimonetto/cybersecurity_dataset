PUP Friday: Bubbling Over
At Malwarebytes Labs, we’re never short of PUPs to analyse and explore. As per our telemetry to date, SweetIM is one of the top PUPs Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (MBAM) detects and removes from our clients systems. In order to get to know what SweetIM software does on a user’s system, we have selected Bubble Hit by GamePacks (MD5: 0326564318717b9826c4b81eb5d34239).
What is SweetIM?
It is a software product of a company with the same name, SweetIM Technologies LTD, which according to their EULA, is formerly known as the company, Imvent LTD. SweetIM software can be downloaded from its official website, www[DOT]sweetim[DOT]com, but as the brand is associated with third-party affiliates, users can expect to find SweetIM bundled with other free, publicly available software.
SweetIM can be installed on Windows and Mac OS X.
What is Bubble Hit by GamePacks?
Bubble Hit is a bubble shooting game wherein players are asked to clear the colored bubbles from a board by connecting at least three bubbles of the same color. There’s an online version of similar games like this that doesn’t require any installation.

What happens when you install and execute SweetIM?
Bubble Hit by GamePacks, in particular, installs like any other software. Below is a slideshow of the program’s interface shown in succession after double-clicking the installer file:

Conclusion
We’re reminding our readers once again to take extra care when downloading freebies like games and software online. While most PUPs still rely on this kind of lure, others have already begun using fake notifications, such as software updates or ads on Web pages, to get users to click, download, and install them without a second thought. However dodgy and/or malicious files arrive on systems, it is always best to keep your AV software updated and set to real-time blocking. Scanning files to make sure they’re safe to execute can also be a good computing practice if you’re unsure of the legitimacy of their legitimacy.
Stay safe, everyone!
