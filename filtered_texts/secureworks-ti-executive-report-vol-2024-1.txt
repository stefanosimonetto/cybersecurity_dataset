HIGH-PROFILE VULNERABILITIES CONTINUE TO ATTRACT THREAT ACTORS
[Word Count: 7]

Patching a vulnerability promptly is best, but late is better than never.
[Word Count: 12]

In early November, CTU researchers warned customers that LockBit ransomware affiliates were exploiting a critical
[Word Count: 15]

vulnerability affecting Citrix NetScaler appliances. The vulnerability, dubbed ‘Citrix Bleed’, provides an example of how
[Word Count: 15]

exploitation of high-profile vulnerabilities can grow, increasing the level of risk to organizations.
[Word Count: 13]

Citrix disclosed Citrix Bleed in early October. A proof-of-concept exploit was released in late October. On October 31,
[Word Count: 18]

Mandiant claimed to have detected exploitation as early as August. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
[Word Count: 16]

Agency (CISA) added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog on October 18 and released
[Word Count: 17]

patching guidance in early November. Ransomware and state-sponsored actors continued to exploit the vulnerability
[Word Count: 14]

throughout November, prompting CISA to publish an advisory in late November.
[Word Count: 11]

The speed and order of the discover-warn-exploit cycle depends on factors such as who first discovers the vulnerability
[Word Count: 18]

and how quickly (if ever) the vendor issues a fix. However, one aspect is relatively consistent: exploitation starts to
[Word Count: 19]

happen days or even hours after threat actors find out about the vulnerability. The publication of a proof-of-concept
[Word Count: 18]

exploit that explains how to abuse the vulnerability only hastens that step. Threat actors can use specialized search
[Word Count: 18]

engines that help them identify unpatched instances of the vulnerable system.
[Word Count: 11]

CTU researchers regularly urge organizations to apply appropriate patches or mitigations as soon as they are available.
[Word Count: 17]

‘Scan-and-exploit’ is one of the top ways that ransomware actors gain initial access to systems, making timely
[Word Count: 17]

patching of internet-facing systems essential. We understand that patching is a complex and costly process and can
[Word Count: 17]

pose difficulties, so we also advise organizations to prioritize patching according to their business risk profile. That
[Word Count: 17]

prioritization requires assessing the amount of threat a vulnerability poses to the organization. Considerations should
[Word Count: 15]

include factors such as whether the vulnerability affects an internet-facing system, if authentication is required to
[Word Count: 16]

access the system, and if exploit code is publicly available.
[Word Count: 10]

The Secureworks® Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) research team analyzes security threats to help 
organizations protect their systems. Based on observations in November and December, CTU™ 
researchers identified the following noteworthy issues and changes in the global threat landscape:
[Word Count: 38]

•	 High-profile vulnerabilities continue to attract threat actors
[Word Count: 8]

•	 Unchanged default passwords open doors for attackers
[Word Count: 8]

•	 IRON FRONTIER used spearphishing against British politicians

[Word Count: 17]

This assessment cannot be based on a one-time static calculation. The level of threat that a specific vulnerability poses
[Word Count: 19]

can quickly change dramatically, and patching prioritization must adapt accordingly. A low-severity vulnerability that
[Word Count: 14]

initially appeared to be a minor threat can suddenly become far more dangerous. For example, threat actors could
[Word Count: 18]

‘chain’ two low-severity Microsoft Windows vulnerabilities disclosed in 2023 to conduct a covert attack without needing
[Word Count: 16]

to trick the victim into clicking a malicious link.
[Word Count: 9]

In addition, threat actors continue to search for unpatched vulnerabilities years after they are disclosed. Every year,
[Word Count: 17]

CISA publishes a list of ‘top routinely exploited vulnerabilities’ for the previous year. Vulnerabilities from 2019 and earlier
[Word Count: 18]

Evaluating and addressing the threats an organization faces is not a one-time exercise. Citrix Bleed is just one example
[Word Count: 19]

of why regular and timely patching is essential.
[Word Count: 8]

Use CISA’s KEV catalog and ‘top routinely exploited vulnerabilities’ list to inform your vulnerability and patch
[Word Count: 16]

UNCHANGED DEFAULT PASSWORDS OPEN DOORS FOR ATTACKERS
[Word Count: 7]

Keeping the manufacturer’s default password leaves systems open to attack.
[Word Count: 10]

In November, CISA warned that Iranian threat actors were actively exploiting Unitronics programmable logic controllers
[Word Count: 15]

(PLCs) used in the water and wastewater systems sector. The supposed hacktivists (a probable front for Iranian
[Word Count: 17]

state-sponsored threat actors) targeted users of the Israeli-made equipment in multiple countries. One of CISA’s
[Word Count: 15]

recommendations was to change all default passwords on the controllers.
[Word Count: 10]

It is common for internet of things (IoT) and operational technology (OT) systems to ship with default credentials that
[Word Count: 19]

customers are expected to change before deployment. However, as CISA stated in guidance aimed at manufacturers
[Word Count: 16]

of these systems, “Years of evidence have demonstrated that relying upon thousands of customers to change their
[Word Count: 17]

passwords is insufficient…” Some default passwords are hard-coded and cannot be changed. In addition, lists of default
[Word Count: 17]

passwords are easy to find on the internet. It is too early to tell if or when manufacturers will respond to this guidance.
[Word Count: 23]

However, threat actors, whether hacktivists, state-sponsored groups, or cybercriminals, will continue to target IoT and
[Word Count: 15]

Default passwords make it easier for threat actors to compromise systems. Organizations should replace default
[Word Count: 15]

passwords with strong passwords as soon as they can. They should also further protect their systems with additional
[Word Count: 18]

controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
[Word Count: 6]

Establish and enforce an organizational policy to identify and change default passwords.

IRON FRONTIER USED SPEARPHISHING AGAINST BRITISH POLITICIANS
[Word Count: 7]

The Russian threat group conducts cyberespionage attacks to support Russia’s political and military 
activities. The UK is just one of its targets.
[Word Count: 22]

Each of Russia’s three intelligence agencies operates or works with threat groups that conduct cyberattacks against
[Word Count: 16]

Russia’s enemies. In December, the UK, U.S., and allies tied the IRON FRONTIER threat group (also known as Star
[Word Count: 19]

Blizzard) to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) Center 18. IRON FRONTIER focuses on gathering foreign
[Word Count: 15]

intelligence and has been linked to spearphishing attacks against military and government organizations, journalists,
[Word Count: 14]

and think tanks in Europe, the U.S., and Russia's near abroad. It steals credentials to gain access to sensitive email
[Word Count: 20]

According to the UK government, the group was behind a sustained effort to target the UK democratic process,
[Word Count: 18]

including cyberattacks on UK civil servants, Members of Parliament, journalists, and non-governmental organizations.
[Word Count: 13]

Some attacks targeted email accounts belonging to British politicians and high-profile Brexit campaigners. Previous U.S.
[Word Count: 15]

targets included staff at three national laboratories: Argonne National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and
[Word Count: 14]

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. IRON FRONTIER’s attacks continued through 2023.
[Word Count: 10]

Spearphishing is used by both cybercriminals and state-sponsored threat actors. It often involves research to ensure
[Word Count: 16]

that the initial outreach is tailored to avoid suspicion and be as convincing as possible. IRON FRONTIER is known to
[Word Count: 20]

create email accounts impersonating targets’ contacts to boost the appearance of legitimacy. The threat actors may
[Word Count: 16]

User education for all employees, including senior executives, is essential to protect organizations against spearphishing
[Word Count: 15]

from IRON FRONTIER and other threat groups. However, organizations cannot depend solely on users for their defense.
[Word Count: 17]

Awareness must be part of a broader set of defenses that include MFA and comprehensive monitoring.
[Word Count: 16]

Review the joint publication tying IRON FRONTIER to the FSB for further details about the threat group’s
[Word Count: 17]

Whether cyberattacks are opportunistic as in most cybercrime, or targeted for political or 
military purposes, many threat actors conduct exhaustive preparatory research. This research can 
involve scanning for unpatched servers, combing through leaks of stolen or default credentials, 
or investigating potential victims to fine-tune spearphishing attacks. Effective cyber defense 
strategies are multilayered and include prompt patching, MFA, comprehensive monitoring, and 
user education to stop threat actors from successfully leveraging their findings.
