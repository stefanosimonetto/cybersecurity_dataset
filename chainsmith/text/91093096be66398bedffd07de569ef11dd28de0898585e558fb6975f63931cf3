More Replica Automated Mails Lead to Fake Pharma
In a blog post last November, we talked about a replica YouTube notification spam that tells recipients about their “delayed/deferred mails”.
If you’re still wondering how a video streaming service can, in some way, notify users of missed emails without providing further context, you’ll find that the individual or group behind this new batch of fake automated mails are none the wiser.
We are able to retrieve three samples of emails purportedly from Facebook, WhatsApp, and Skype—all of which follow a similar ploy we’ve seen that fake YouTube email used before. The format are identical to each other as well.
All links on each spam lead to redirector PHP pages housed on compromised sites. Below illustrates simple redirection schemes for each of the spam messages we looked into:
