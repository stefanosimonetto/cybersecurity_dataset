After updating from 4.015 or earlier to 4.017, a new kernel (2.4.22) is used for enhanced hardware features and drivers. This new kernel has new ACPI/APIC handling and may conflict with faulty ACPI BIOS implementations. By default we did not change any ACPI/APIC settings, which resulted in full ACPI/APIC support for users having started with a 4.000 and APIC support (without ACPI) for users having started with a 4.008 ISO installation.
In case you  encounter a problem with 4.017 Up2Date when booting up the system (NICs/controllers not recognized/working), please try the following:

On the LILO boot prompt, type: "default noapic"
Boot up and check your system
In case this did not help, type: "default noapic acpi=off"
Boot up and check your system
Add the needed parameters to the append line in /emergency/boot/etc/lilo.conf
Call: "lilo -r /emergency/boot"

We republished the Up2Date 4.017, making sure everybody has both parameters in his configuration file for compatibility reasons. In case you want to use  ACPI/APIC either use 4.017 ISO or remove the parameters mentioned above in the lilo config file.
In case you still have problems with ACPI/APIC please check for a newer BIOS version or try disabling ACPI/APIC in the BIOS. This new version of Up2Date 4.017 will automatically replace prefetched but not applied prior version of the package. After fetching this  Up2Date 4.017 again you will receive an additional notification by email.
If you did not encounter any problems with the prior version there is no need to reapply the Up2Date 4.017.
Up2Date 4.017
Remarks

Required previous version is 4.016
Existing configuration will not be changed
!!! ATTENTION – FIREWALL WILL REBOOT AFTER UP2DATE !!!
!!! Astaro recommends always to test Up2Date packages with a new kernel
and reboot on non-production systems first. !!!
