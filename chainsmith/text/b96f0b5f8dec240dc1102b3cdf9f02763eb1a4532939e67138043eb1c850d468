Security researchers from Webroot have intercepted a currently active, client-side exploits-serving malicious campaign that has already managed to infect 18,544 computers across the globe, through the BlackHole web malware exploitation kit.
More details:

The BlackHole Web malware exploitation kit is currently serving the following exploits: Java Rhino; Java OBE; MDA; PDF ALL; PDF LIBTIFF; HCP; FLASH.
As you can seen in the attached screenshot, the cybercriminals managed to infect 14091 hosts using the Java Rhino exploit, 2643 hosts using the PDF LIBTIFF exploit, 662 hosts using the PDF ALL Exploit, 533 hosts using the Java OBE exploit, and 396 hosts using the FLASH exploit. The campaign alsos managed to infect 7571 Windows 7 hosts, 6558 Windows XP hosts, and 4363 Windows Vista hosts, next to 7 Mac OS X hosts.
The campaign is relying on traffic redirected through multiple campaigns which usually take place using traffic exchange networks. In these networks, cybercriminals will exchange traffic that they have aggregated using, for instance, black hat search engine optimization tactics, or directly embed client-side exploits serving iFrames within bogus adult web sites.
Client-side exploits are served from the following URLs:

Multiple independent reports are confirming that client-side exploits remain the most lucrative end and corporate user exploitation tactic, thanks to the fact that end users aren’t patching their third-party applications and browser plugins.
Users are advised to ensure that you’re not running any outdated software, next to browser plugins.
