Cybercriminals are currently mass mailing tens of thousands of emails, in an attempt to trick users into thinking that the order for their “air transportation services has been accepted and processed”. In reality though, once users execute the malicious attachments, their PCs will automatically become part of the botnet managed by the malicious actors.
More details:
Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

Detection rate for the malicious attachment: MD5: 97c9c3b4d50171a07305f91c1885ef9f – detected by 24 out of 43 antivirus scanners as Worm:Win32/Cridex.E
Once executed, the sample creates the following processess on the affected hosts:
C:WINDOWSsystem32cmd.exe” /c “C:DOCUME~1<USER>~1LOCALS~1Tempexp1.tmp.bat””
C:Documents and Settings<USER>Application DataKB00927107.exe

It then phones back to the following C&C servers:

We’ve already seen one of the C&C IPs (213.214.74.5) in the following previously profiled malicious campaigns:
