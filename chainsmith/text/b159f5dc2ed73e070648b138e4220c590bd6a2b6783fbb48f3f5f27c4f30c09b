Lunker

I’ve been looking forward to the release of Lunker, a spear Phishing toolkit for pentesters. It was originally reported to be part of the OWASP live CD due out this month. We just dont have the budget for phishme (although it is cheap).
Unfortunately according to a comment on this post over at hackyourself.net they are getting a case of the conscience. “Its too ripe for exploitation”. So they are going to take a couple months to make it less ready to go. The rationale is that with metasploit anyone can patch and protect themselves from that. You can’t patch the users against social engineering.
