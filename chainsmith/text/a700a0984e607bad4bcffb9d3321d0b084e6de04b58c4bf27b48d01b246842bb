New AVCompartivies Report

Posted by Roger on 19 April 2007, 9:00 pm

AVComparatives.org has a new report comparing malware testing organizations. Based on the subject “Anti-Virus Testing Websites: An Overview on Which Testing Sites can be trusted and which cannot” I was kind of expecting a comparison of the various online scanners. Instead I’m greeted by a paper with some of their testing philosophy and why they are better than everyone else.
It didn’t do much for me, but I’d still suggest adding their RSS feed to your reader so you can keep up on their new studies.
