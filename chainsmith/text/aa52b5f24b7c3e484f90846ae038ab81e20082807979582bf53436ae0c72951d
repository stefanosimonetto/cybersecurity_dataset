Today we have released ASG 8.201 and 8.200 to our installations via the Astaro Up2Date system. 8.201 solidifies the 8.2 release and should be applied along with 8.200. We took the opportunity to further increase the Web Filtering throughput, address a few bugs, and polish the 8.200 release.

You can view the initial 8.200 announcement here, while the 8.2 release notes are located here.
We still plan to release a feature which allows you to re-inject a past Web Security log for report regeneration in a future 8.20x Up2Dates. More information will be communicated on this as it is known. Note that when you are updating from 8.103, you can push the "Update to latest version" which will apply both 8.200 and 8.201 in order, and then reboot only once.
