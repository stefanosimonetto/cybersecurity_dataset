On a daily basis we process multiple malicious campaigns that, in 95%+ of cases, rely on the market leading Black Hole Exploit Kit. The fact that this Web malware exploitation kit is the kit of choice for the majority of cybercriminals, speaks for its key differentiation factors/infection rate success compared to the competing exploit kits, like, for instance, the Sweet Orange exploit kit or the Nuclear Exploit pack v2.0.
In this post I’ll profile the EgyPack, a Web malware exploitation kit that was originally advertised on invite-only/vetted cybercrime friendly communities between the period of 2009-2011. List its core features, provide exclusive screenshots of its administration panel, and discuss why its business model failed to scale, leading to its virtually non-existent market share.
More details:

Cybercrime ecosystem advertisement of the EgyPack Web malware exploitation kit:

-Unique Filtration System with No Duplicates for Traffic using techniques for checking for each unique visitor using cookies with mutex being updated when you clear the stats and checking for ip address .
The price? Between $1,000/1,500, with the idea to make it look like as if the core purpose of its existence is to be exclusively coded for members of this particular invite-only/vetted cybercrime-friendly community. Let’s take a peek inside the command and control interface.

The EgyPack is an example of an OPSEC-aware cybercriminal who has never sacrificed security for the sake of attracting new customers thru advertising his Web malware exploitation kit at publicly accessible cybercrime-friendly communities. Hence, the low market share, which may prove to be irrelevant in this specific case, as this is exactly what the cybercriminal behind it wanted to accomplish in the context of enriching the experience of the members of the invite-only/vetted cybercrime-friendly community.
As the exploit kit remains under development, we’ll continue monitoring the activities of the cybercriminal behind it, and post updates as soon as he introduces new features/exploits. Meanwhile, user are advised to ensure that they’re running the latest versions of their third-party software, and browser plugins in an attempt to mitigate a certain percentage of the risk posed by the fact that on a large-scale, cybercriminals tend to exploit known and already patched client-side vulnerabilities.
