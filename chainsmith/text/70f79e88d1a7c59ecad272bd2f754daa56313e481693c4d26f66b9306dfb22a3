We have recently intercepted a malicious spam campaign, that’s attempting to trick users into thinking that they’ve received a non-existent “changelog.” Once gullible and socially engineered users execute the malicious attachment, their PCs automatically become part of the botnet operated by the cybercriminal/gang of cybercriminals.
More details:
Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

Detection rate for the malicious attachment:
MD5: e01ea945b8d055c5c115ab58749ac502 – detected by 23 out of 46 antivirus scanners as Worm:Win32/Cridex.E.
Upon execution, the sample creates the following processess on the affected hosts:
C:WINDOWSsystem32cmd.exe” /c “C:DOCUME~1<USER>~1LOCALS~1Tempexp1.tmp.bat
C:Documents and Settings<USER>Application DataKB00927107.exe
The following Registry Keys:
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCFBDC89D4
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTS25BC2D7B
The following Registry Values:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun] -> KB00121600.exe = “”%AppData%KB00121600.exe””
As well as the following Mutexes:

LocalXMM00000200
LocalXMM000003F8
LocalXMI000003F8

LocalXMM0000009C

LocalXMM000000C8

It then phones back to hxxp://85.214.143.90:8080/DPNilBA/ue1elBAAAA/tlSHAAAAA/ and to hxxp://91.121.90.92:8080/AJtw/UCyqrDAA/Ud+asDAA/
We’ve already seen the same C&C (85.214.143.90) used in a previously profiled malicious campaign:

‘Terminated Wire Transfer Notification/ACH File ID” themed malicious campaigns lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit
