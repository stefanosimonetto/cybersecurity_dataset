Kindle owners, watch what you click on!
Cybercriminals are currently attempting to trick Kindle owners into thinking that they’ve received a receipt from an E-book purchase from Amazon.com. In reality, when users click on any of the links found in the malicious emails, they’re automatically exposed to the  client-side exploits served by the Black Hole Exploit Kit.

Sample compromised URLs used in the campaign:

Sample client-side exploits serving URL:
hxxp://starsoftgroup.net/detects/weeks_movie_whether.php
Sample malicious payload dropping URLs:
hxxp://starsoftgroup.net/detects/weeks_movie_whether.php?jf=31:2v:33:1o:1m&le=2w:2v:1o:1g:1m:31:1l:1k:30:1k&s=1f&tf=s&kv=r

Malicious domain name reconnaissance:
starsoftgroup.net – 175.121.229.209; 198.144.191.50 – Email: wondermitch@hotmail.com
Name Server: NS1.HTTP-PAGE.NET
Name Server: NS2.HTTP-PAGE.NET
We’ve already seen the same name servers used in the following previously profiled campaigns, indicating that they’ve been launched by the same cybercriminals:

Fake ‘FedEx Online Billing – Invoice Prepared to be Paid’ themed emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit
Fake LinkedIn ‘Invitation Notifications’ themed emails lead to client-side exploits and malware
Bogus ‘Your Paypal Transaction Confirmation’ themed emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit

Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 13d23f4c1eb1d4d3841e2de50b1948cc – detected by 7 out of 46 antivirus scanners as UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic.
Once executed, the sample creates the following processes on the affected hosts:
C:WINDOWSsystem32cmd.exe” /c “C:DOCUME~1<USER>~1LOCALS~1Tempexp1.tmp.bat
C:Documents and Settings<USER>Application DataKB00927107.exe
The following Registry Keys:
REGISTRYUSERS-1-5-21-299502267-926492609-1801674531-500SoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTS9CC20790
REGISTRYUSERS-1-5-21-299502267-926492609-1801674531-500SoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCBA6D3F36
As well as the following Mutexes:
LocalXMM000001C4
LocalXMI000001C4
LocalXMM00000380
LocalXMI00000380
Upon execution, the sample also phones back to the following C&C servers:
hxxp://195.191.22.90:8080/DPNilBA/ue1elBAAAA/tlSHAAAAA/
hxxp://37.122.209.102:8080/DPNilBA/ue1elBAAAA/tlSHAAAAA/
hxxp://217.65.100.41:8080/DPNilBA/ue1elBAAAA/tlSHAAAAA/

hxxp://213.214.74.5/J9/vp//EGa+AAAAAA/2MB9vCAAAA/
hxxp://180.235.150.72/J9/vp//EGa+AAAAAA/2MB9vCAAAA/
We’ve already seen the same pseudo-random C&C communication characters (DPNilBA) used in the following campaigns:

As well as the same C&C server IPs (173.201.177.77; 210.56.23.100; 180.235.150.72) in the following campaigns, indicating that they’ve been launched by the same malicious party:
