Investigating a Compromised Server with Rootcheck

heWhat do you do if you suspect your server (VPS or dedicated) has been compromised? If you are a customer, you have the option to leverage our team to perform the incident response on your behalf. What if you want to do an investigation on your own?
In this post, we will talk about Rootcheck, an open source command line tool that looks for indicators of compromise on Linux or BSD systems. It looks for known backdoors, kernel-level rootkits, malware and insecure configuration settings. It performs a few tests that will certainly help you during your hack investigation.
Rootcheck is included as part of OSSEC (which we also recommend when running your own server). It provides continuous endpoint monitoring, alerting and visibility into your environment. However, if you have not been running OSSEC or are just inspecting a server to see the current state, Rootcheck can be executed on demand and will provide a baseline view of the system.
Getting started with Rootcheck
Rootcheck is packaged separately and can be downloaded directly from our code repository or from here to get the latest stable version:
$ wget http://dcid.me/ossec-packages/rootcheck-latest.tar.gz
After downloading Rootcheck, untar the package, run the install script and get it running:
$ tar -zxvf rootcheck-latest.tar.gz
$ cd *rootcheck*
$ sudo ./install.sh
Once the installation is finished, you will see a file called “rootcheck” created in your current directory. Execute that file to get the rootcheck audit started:
$ sudo ./rootcheck
..
** Starting Rootcheck v2016-02 **
** http://dcid.me/rootcheck/ **
Be patient, it may take a few minutes to complete…
[INFO]: Starting rootcheck scan.
[OK]: No presence of public rootkits detected. Analyzed 269 files.
[OK]: No binaries with any trojan detected. Analyzed 76 files.
You should see the same message as above, informing you that Rootcheck has started and is scanning your server. If any rootkits are identified, you will be alerted. For example, if you have an out-of-date CMS (i.e., WordPress, Drupal or Joomla), the following alerts will be displayed:
[INFO]: System Audit: Web vulnerability – Outdated Drupal 7 installation. File: /var/www/vhosts/site.com/includes/bootstrap.inc. Reference: http://sucuri.net/latest-versions .
[INFO]: System Audit: Web vulnerability – Outdated Drupal 7 installation. File: /var/www/vhosts/site2.com/includes/bootstrap.inc. Reference: http://sucuri.net/latest-versions .
If it finds web-based malware, like the Filesman backdoor, it will provide the following alert:
[INFO]: System Audit: Web malware – Backdoors / Web based malware found – Filesman shell. File: /var/www/vhosts/site.com/lic.class.php.
Additionally, as part of the audit, Rootcheck will parse through your web logs on the server and identify the latest login attempts and their location and display it as such:
[INFO]: Latest successful logins to the server:
root |28 |
srcip: ‘192.x.x.x / USA / New Jersey’
srcip: ’75.x.x.x / USA / California’
srcip: ‘170.x.x.x / USA / Utah’
admin |1 |
srcip: ‘132.x.x.x / Russia’
