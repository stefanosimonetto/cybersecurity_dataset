Cybercriminals are currently mass mailing millions of emails, in an attempt to trick Bank of America customers into clicking on the exploit and malware-serving link found in the spamvertised email. Relying on bogus “Online Banking Passcode Changed” notifications and professionally looking email templates, the campaign is the latest indication of the systematic rotation of impersonated brands in an attempt to cover as many market segments as possible.
More details:

We’ve already seen the same email (windowclouse@hotmail.com) used in a previously profiled malicious campaign impersonating Intuit – “‘Intuit Payroll Confirmation inquiry’ themed emails lead to the Black Hole exploit kit“, where the client-side exploit-serving URL (art-london.net) was also registered with the same email.
Related malicious domains responding the these IPs:
change-hot.net

Money mule recruitment domains using the same IP as a mailserver:
aurafinancialgroup.com
epscareers.com
As you can see, this campaign is great example of the very existence of the cybercrime ecosystem. Not only are they spamvertising millions of exploits and malware serving emails, they’re also multitasking on multiple fronts, as these two domains are recruiting money mules to process fraudulently obtained assets from the affected victims.
