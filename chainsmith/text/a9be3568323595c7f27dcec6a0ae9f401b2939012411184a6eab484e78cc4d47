As you can see our generic rule to catch hidden iframes was the most popular, followed by Blackhat SEO Spam. After that, we got a lot of web sites infected with oscommerce-related malware, ‚ÄúHilary Kneber‚Äù and a few others‚Ä¶ You can copy and paste any of the above domains to get more details.
We will do this breakdown every few months to see how those numbers are changing.
