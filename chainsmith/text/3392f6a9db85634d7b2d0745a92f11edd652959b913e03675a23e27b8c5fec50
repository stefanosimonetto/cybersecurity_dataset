Compromised WordPress sites launch drive-by attacks off Pirate Bay clone
WordPress, the leading Content Management System, is one of cyber criminals’ favourite target when it comes to hacking websites.
Contrary to some beliefs, it’s not because WordPress is a bad or insecurely designed CMS.
As it is often the case, problems often come from the users themselves who aren’t keeping it up to date or like to tear it apart instead of doing proper coding.
While legitimate sites getting hacked is very common, there are times when the patterns and timing are so similar that they indicate an organized effort from the bad guys.
During the past few days, we have been detecting several WordPress sites that were injected with the same iframe. Although we don’t have exact numbers on sites that have been affected, we are assuming that it is a substantial attack.

This kind of placement is odd and so is the content: thepiratebay.in.ua. Why would regular websites link to what looks like a Pirate Bay website?

To be clear, this is not the officially maintained Pirate Bay, but rather a clone through The Open Bay project:
The Isohunt.to team have decided to give an early Christmas present to Pirate Bay fans. They’ve launched “The Open Bay,” an initiative that allows anyone to put a ‘copy’ of The Pirate Bay online, minimal technical knowledge required. –Excerpt from TorrentFreak.
Still, it does not answer the question of why bad guys would want to insert an iframe to this site. Perhaps click fraud or rogue affiliate behaviour?
We found the real reason behind this pretty quickly. The Pirate Bay clone is actively pushing the Nuclear exploit kit with an iframe and will infect vulnerable visitors via drive-by download attacks.

Flash exploit for version 16.0.0.287 and under (CVE-2015-0311)

Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit users are already protected against this threat. Interestingly, any search on the portal returns no result at the moment, and the error message could not be anymore spot on: “404 sh*t happens”

Payload
The payload, detected by Malwarebytes Anti-Malware appears to belong to a banking Trojan.
Upon execution, it injects into iexplore.exe and the following registry keys are created:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Yrubwkjp
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Yrubwkjp
It calls back to a command and control server at usabrent.ru, a domain name created just a few days ago.
Indicators of compromise
A thread on Stack Overflow discusses very similar iframe injections into WordPress sites.
While for visitors the problem looks like a straight iframe, website owners need to look for obfuscated code within their PHP files as well as possible backdoors.
What may such code look like? Here’s an example:

It may not be terribly obvious but certain signs such as the detection of search engines, the use of base64 encoding should be raising some red flags.
This Base64 snippet:

Again, the code on your server may very well vary but this gives you an idea of what to look for. If you aren’t sure about this, you can scan your site with Sucuri’s free sitecheck which may also identify vulnerabilities:

For example, the above WordPress site was running an outdated version of the RevSlider plugin. Late last year, Sucuri exposed a massive campaign of WordPress compromises dubbed “SoakSoak” through a RevSlider vulnerability.
It’s possible this latest wave of attacks is somehow connected with the “SoakSoak” campaign and its authors, although it is too early to tell at this point.
To avoid getting their sites hacked, WordPress users need to check that they are running the latest WP install and that all their plugins are up to date. Other proper hygiene tips such as strong passwords and avoiding public wifi when logging into your site should also be applied.
