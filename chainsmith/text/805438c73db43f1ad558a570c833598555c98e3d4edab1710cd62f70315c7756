We’ve already seen these domains and IPs used in previously profiled campaigns such as the “Spamvertised ‘Fwd: Scan from a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet’ emails lead to Black Hole exploit kit“, and the “Cybercriminals impersonate Intuit Market, mass mail millions of exploits and malware serving emails” campaign.
This isn’t the first time we’ve profiled malicious campaigns impersonating the United Parcel Service. Consider going through related posts profiling the dynamics of related campaigns:
