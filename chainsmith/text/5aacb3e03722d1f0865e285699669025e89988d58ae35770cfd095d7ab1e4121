Network up2date

Astaro is pleased to announce that Astaro Security Gateway V7.1 GA is available now.   Version 7.1 integrates exciting new Web Security features like Active Directory SSO native mode, improved performance, lower resource usage (without squid now), intelligent caching, re-added black/whitelist and audio/video streaming support.

On top of that we now support interface based packet filter rules, offer a detailed network accounting report and much more.   Furthermore you will experience convenience changes and performance improvements.
What’s new in ASG V7.1?
The new HTTP proxy provides the following major enhancements:
Active Directory native mode (NTLMv2/Kerberos)
Added support for NTLMv2/Kerberos authentication, which is required to authenticate against a Windows Domain Controller running in Native Mode.
Concurrent usage of black and white lists per profile
Within HTTP profiles you can now define filter actions that block and allow access to dedicated URLs/sites at the same time.
Streaming media bypass
Scanning of video and audio streams can be selectively disabled in order to avoid delays caused by downloading and scanning the entire stream through the HTTP proxy prior to playing.
Block content before download
File extension filter rules are now applied before downloading a file.
Dynamic configuration changes without restart
The new proxy now reloads its configuration without terminating existing connections
Profile/Filteraction logging
To help troubleshooting wrong profile/filter assignment matching, the used profile and filter action is now logged in the http logfile.
HTTP Proxy scans POST request bodies
The proxy now employs virus scanning for bodies sent with POST requests to foreign servers as well. If the body contains a Virus, the content is blocked with ‘403 Forbidden’.
Improved performance
Intelligent caching capabilities, support of HTTP 1.1 connection keepalive and a new IO model allow for increased network performance of up to 80% depending on hardware and content scanning configuration.   Besides HTTP proxy enhancements the new release also includes the following new features:

Packet filter based on interface
Auto-Packetfilter rule generation for NAT traffic
SPAM Scanner with X-SPAM Flag
Network Accounting/Usage
Contentfilter double byte support
Virtual HA MAC-Addresses (MAC address takeover)
Multiple-IP-Check Uplink Failover
>utomatic user creation support for eDir SSO
DynDNS-for-Static-Ethernet
Disabling of proxy and IPS exceptions
Disabling of aliases on network interfaces
Global NAT Traversal option

A detailed description of the new features, changes, system requirements as well as installation and upgrade information is included within the    Astaro Security Gateway V7.1 Release Notes.   The Astaro Security Gateway Administration Guide, a hardware compatibility list and a Known Issues List for the GA release are available on our knowledge base.

Astaro minimum recommendation for V7.1 BETA installations:   Intel Pentium III 900 MHz, 512MB RAM, 10 GB hard disk drive and above.
Best performance results running on: Dual Xeon or Athlon, 2GB RAM, 36 GB SCSI 15krpm hard disk drive and above.
For proved hardware components please check our Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) at: http://www.astaro.com/lists/HCL-ASG-V7.txt

Up2Date 7.100
Remarks:

System will reboot after Up2Date
Existing configuration will not be changed
Customers upgrading from versions prior to 7.100 MUST re-join the Firewall to the AD domain if they use SSO. In order to join the AD domain, the firewall must find a DC (Domain Controller) machine. In previous versions, this was done with a NetBIOS broadcast.
Starting with ASG 7.100, pure AD (native) mode is used, which in turn requires finding the DC with a DNS lookup. There are also more strict requirements on DNS resolution and time differences. The following conditions must be met:
– The time zone on the firewall and the DC must be the same.
– There MUST NOT be a time difference of more than five minutes between the firewall clock and the DC clock.
– The ASG hostname must exist in the AD DNS system.
– The ASG must use the AD DNS as forwarder, or must have a DNS request route for the AD domain which points to the AD DNS server.
