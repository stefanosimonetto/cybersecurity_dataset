ASG 8.308 Up2Date Released

We have started to spread ASG Up2Date 8.308, which finalizes the process for one-touch upgrading to UTM 9 for supported appliances by solving a few issues and polishing the operation across all remaining models. Note that HA/Clustering systems are not yet supported and will unlock at a later date in early 2013. As part of the adjustments, you now need to be at ASG 8.308 to perform the UTM 9 one-touch upgrade, so install this release before attempting, as version 8.306 and 8.307 will not be allowed to upgrade anymore. Note that if you have already downloaded the one-touch upgrade on your appliance but did not install it, you will need to re-download it so it can use the updated process and bring you to UTM 9.004+ directly. For more information, read on for the rest of the details.
