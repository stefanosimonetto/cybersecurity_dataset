Network up2date

Today we have released ASG 8.202 to increase performance in many areas, especially for the Web Filtering engine.  This release addresses the majority of the issues reported by users of 8.200/8.201, and greatly enhances the stability of your Astaro Security Gateway V8.2 installation.

We still plan to release a feature which allows you to re-inject a  past Web Security log for report regeneration in a future 8.20x  Up2Date. More information will be communicated on this as it is known.  Note that when you are updating from 8.103, you can push the "Update to  latest version" button, which will apply Up2Dates 8.200, 8.201, and 8.202 in order, and then  reboot only one time.
