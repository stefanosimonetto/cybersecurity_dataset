The word gullible isn’t in the dictionary

I was on a break between Masters programs and needed some structured education to make me open a book. I decided to take a class that the community college was offering in Computer Security. As part of the class we were required to give a 10 minute presentation on something related to the class.
One of my classmates got up and talked about information warfare. As an example he cited the gulf war printer virus! For those of you who don’t know in 1992 US News and World Report ran a story reporting that just before the first gulf war, the NSA intercepted printers bound for Iraq. They are supposed to have replaced the chips inside the printer with chips containing a virus. To this day, some Generals credit the Gulf War virus with knocking out Iraqi RADAR installations.
Unfortunately the Gulf War virus story was originally written as an APRIL FOOLS gag in 1992.

I considered making my talk about refuting the Gulf War Printer virus hoax, but discretion being the better part of valor (whatever that means) I chose not to directly refute this student. Rather I gave a talk about virus hoaxes.
I talked about how to identify virus hoaxes and ridiculed people’s credulity regarding outlandish claims that show up in the email inbox. It was a thing of beauty. A great didactic moment. At the end there was time for questions, and the gulf war printer guy asks if its true that viruses are propagated by antivirus companies to spur business. I guess some people never learn.
