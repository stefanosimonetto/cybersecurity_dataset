Network up2date UTM UTM 9

A new Up2Date is available for Sophos UTM. Release 9.105 fixes three bugs and applies a security fix to WebAdmin which we recommend to apply with priority.

Sophos UTM 9.105

Special Note
In some cases, due to bug 27580 mentioned below, UTM WebAdmin may not show an available up2date package. If the value for the “Latest Check” date for the version information on the WebAdmin Dashboard seems unusually high you may need to reboot the UTM as a workaround. This will restart the Up2Date service and correctly check for available updates.

Click on the “Watch Up2Date Progress in new window” and an extra browser window will show the progress of the Up2Date installation. (The System administrator will receive a notification email once the Up2Date process has finished.)
