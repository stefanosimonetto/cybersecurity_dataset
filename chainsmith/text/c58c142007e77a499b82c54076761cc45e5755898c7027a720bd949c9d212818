I glanced at my blackberry during dinner and saw a whole mess of virus alerts such as the following:

The message sender was
[email protected]
The message originating IP was 81.168.6.17 The message recipients were [email protected]$mydomain.com
The message was titled Osama Found Hanged The message date was Thu, 15 Jun 2006 22:02:54 -0700 The message identifier was (empty) The virus or unauthorised code identified in the email is:
/var/qmail/queue/split/0/attach/3384881_4X_AZ-D_PA2__Photo=20and=20Article.exe
Found the W32/Sdbot.worm.gen.as virus !!!
In case its not clear that is the admin notification when someone sends a virus. Looks like another run of viruses being spammed. How many times have they tried the Osama bin Virus since 2001.
