I think "Project Vigilant" is largely a publicity stunt, meaning it was just invented and it's so-called "history" is an extension of someone's imagination.  As we say on my team, "This ain't my first rodeo."  In other words, I've been around for a while.  While I recognize some of the "principals" in this "group," I've never heard of them organized into a "project" -- certainly not with over 500 stealthy members!I'm going to link to a few articles and offer my opinions on the content.First we have the 21 June article Secret group aids fight against terror by Mark Albertson:For the past 14 years, a significant volunteer group of U.S. citizens has been operating in near total secrecy to monitor and report illegal or potentially harmful activity on the Web. 14 years?  Please.  If they have been active for 14 years, why does no one I've asked know who these guys are?The group claims over 500 current members, although their names and identities are still mostly secret. Their members comprise some of the most knowledgeable experts in the field of information security today and include current employees of the U.S. government, law enforcement and the military.Over 500 members?  And they've been able to keep such good OPSEC that no one knows who they are?And if you want to work for them, don’t bother to ask. If they’re interested in you, they’ll find a way to get in touch.Convenient!Finding information about Project Vigilant is not easy. They have a public webpage that reveals little information about the group.$ whois projectvigilant.usDomain Name:                                 PROJECTVIGILANT.USDomain ID:                                   D22426525-USSponsoring Registrar:                        WILD WEST DOMAINS, INC.Registrar URL (registration services):       www.wildwestdomains.comDomain Status:                               clientDeleteProhibitedDomain Status:                               clientRenewProhibitedDomain Status:                               clientTransferProhibitedDomain Status:                               clientUpdateProhibitedRegistrant ID:                               CR18275784Registrant Name:                             Steven RuheRegistrant Organization:                     BBHC Global LLCRegistrant Address1:                         4828 North Kings HighwayRegistrant Address2:                         #126Registrant City:                             Fort PierceRegistrant State/Province:                   FloridaRegistrant Postal Code:                      34951Registrant Country:                          United StatesRegistrant Country Code:                     USRegistrant Phone Number:                     +1.7723326988Registrant Facsimile Number:                 +1.8667288650Registrant Email:                            steven.ruhe@bbhc-global.comRegistrant Application Purpose:              P1Registrant Nexus Category:                   C11Administrative Contact ID:                   CR18275787Administrative Contact Name:                 Steven RuheAdministrative Contact Organization:         BBHC Global LLCAdministrative Contact Address1:             4828 North Kings HighwayAdministrative Contact Address2:             #126Administrative Contact City:                 Fort PierceAdministrative Contact State/Province:       FloridaAdministrative Contact Postal Code:          34951Administrative Contact Country:              United StatesAdministrative Contact Country Code:         USAdministrative Contact Phone Number:         +1.7723326988Administrative Contact Facsimile Number:     +1.8667288650Administrative Contact Email:                steven.ruhe@bbhc-global.comAdministrative Application Purpose:          P1Administrative Nexus Category:               C11Billing Contact ID:                          CR18275789Billing Contact Name:                        Steven RuheBilling Contact Organization:                BBHC Global LLCBilling Contact Address1:                    4828 North Kings HighwayBilling Contact Address2:                    #126Billing Contact City:                        Fort PierceBilling Contact State/Province:              FloridaBilling Contact Postal Code:                 34951Billing Contact Country:                     United StatesBilling Contact Country Code:                USBilling Contact Phone Number:                +1.7723326988Billing Contact Facsimile Number:            +1.8667288650Billing Contact Email:                       steven.ruhe@bbhc-global.comBilling Application Purpose:                 P1Billing Nexus Category:                      C11Technical Contact ID:                        CR18275785Technical Contact Name:                      Steven RuheTechnical Contact Organization:              BBHC Global LLCTechnical Contact Address1:                  4828 North Kings HighwayTechnical Contact Address2:                  #126Technical Contact City:                      Fort PierceTechnical Contact State/Province:            FloridaTechnical Contact Postal Code:               34951Technical Contact Country:                   United StatesTechnical Contact Country Code:              USTechnical Contact Phone Number:              +1.7723326988Technical Contact Facsimile Number:          +1.8667288650Technical Contact Email:                     steven.ruhe@bbhc-global.comTechnical Application Purpose:               P1Technical Nexus Category:                    C11Name Server:                                 NS57.DOMAINCONTROL.COMName Server:                                 NS58.DOMAINCONTROL.COMCreated by Registrar:                        WILD WEST DOMAINS, INC.Last Updated by Registrar:                   WILD WEST DOMAINS, INC.Domain Registration Date:                    Mon Sep 21 23:36:10 GMT 2009Domain Expiration Date:                      Tue Sep 20 23:59:59 GMT 2011Domain Last Updated Date:                    Sat Jul 10 10:11:21 GMT 2010Looks like they registered their Web site last September.The group’s collaboration with the U.S. Government is handled through another highly secure web portal which supports protected email, chat and other features.The article links to https://cybercop.esportals.com/ which is a link from the main Infragard site (once you log in).  The main Infragard site is hosted elsewhere -- I have a login to that since I am an Infragard member.  Project Vigilant is funded by BBHC Global, an information security firm based in the Midwest, and private donations. Uber’s boss is Steven Ruhe, the Managing Member of BBHC Global. “I’ve always been a small town guy with big dreams, “ said Ruhe who was born and raised in Nebraska and sells Amway products on the side.$ whois bbhc-global.comWhois Server Version 2.0Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registeredwith many different competing registrars.

His LinkedIn profile says:Steven RuheOwner, T.G.B.S Construction, Managing Member - BBHC GlobalLincoln, Nebraska AreaOwnerStevenConstruction industryJanuary 2004 – Present (6 years 8 months)I've wanted to be a business owner for as long as I can remember... I work for me I build my dreams, work for someone else build there dreams.This guy is "funding" this "project"?So why is this group coming "out of the shadows?"The group is looking to grow from its current level of 500 volunteers to upwards of 1600. Uber said that he will be recruiting experts in calculus and linguistics in the months ahead. Each potential member of the group must go through a rigorous vetting process that culminates in an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States. “We tell our candidates that we have secrets and you have to keep them,” said Uber. For every 12 potential new members under consideration to join the group, only 3 will ultimately be selected.Good luck with that.  I can't wait to see who applies.  The next major article is Big names help run Project Vigilant, on 22 June, again by Mark Albertson:It’s tempting to look at a secret group of cybercrime “monitors” and dismiss them as a group of lightweights trying to play cops and robbers in the Internet world. Nothing could be farther from the truth...Take Mark Rasch, Project Vigilant’s General Counsel... Chet Uber, the group’s current director, is a founding member of InfraGard (a partnership between the FBI and the private sector) and a longtime participant in AFCEA (Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association)... One of Uber’s top lieutenants is Kevin Manson... George Johnson is the second in command for Project Vigilant... Another recent addition to the group is Ira Winkler... Suzanne Gorman, one of Project Vigilant’s top leaders, is a former security chief for the New York Stock Exchange...So how many of those names do you recgonize?  I know Rasch and Winkler, and I've asked others who know Manson.  Chet Uber? AFCEA membership?  Wow.  Anyone can join AFCEA.  The last major article on this "group" is Stealthy Government Contractor Monitors U.S. Internet Providers, Worked With Wikileaks Informant by Andy Greenberg:A semi-secret government contractor that calls itself Project Vigilant surfaced at the Defcon security conference Sunday with a series of revelations: that it monitors the traffic of 12 regional Internet service providers, hands much of that information to federal agencies, and encouraged one of its "volunteers," researcher Adrian Lamo, to inform the federal government about the alleged source of a controversial video of civilian deaths in Iraq leaked to whistle-blower site Wikileaks in April.This is where I expect some real trouble.  How do you feel about an ISP handing data to some group, who then sends it to "federal agencies"?  According to [Chet] Uber, one of Project Vigilant's manifold methods for gathering intelligence includes collecting information from a dozen regional U.S. Internet service providers (ISPs). Uber declined to name those ISPs, but said that because the companies included a provision allowing them to share users' Internet activities with third parties in their end user license agreements (EULAs), Vigilant was able to legally gather data from those Internet carriers and use it to craft reports for federal agencies. A Vigilant press release says that the organization tracks more than 250 million IP addresses a day and can "develop portfolios on any name, screen name or IP address.""We don't do anything illegal," says Uber. "If an ISP has a EULA to let us monitor traffic, we can work with them. If they don't, we can't."And whether that massive data gathering violates privacy? The organization says it never looks at personally identifying information, though just how it defines that information isn't clear, nor is how it scrubs its data mining for sensitive details.The group doesn't look at PII, yet it develops "portfolios on any name, screen name or IP address"?  I think it's time for some grown-ups to check out these guys.  I don't think their activities will make those ISP's customers happy.My guess is that Chet and friends are trying to jump-start a security company, so they make a big splash at Def Con and then try to hire a few people.  What does anyone else think?
