Facebook Hacks and SMS, Oh My
There’s a supposed “Facebook Hack” website located at
facebookhack(dot)pl
You can tell it’s all about hacking, because they’ve written the word “hack” underneath Facebook in dramatic red letters (well, dramatic MS paint letters).

You’re supposed to enter a profile ID in the box, although you can leave it blank and still receive an “account hacked” message which I guess is pretty impressive:

The page claims they’re blocking spam, and to see the password you’ll need to send an SMS.
Links online suggest it might be an expensive one, so you definitely don’t want to be sending anything via this website – we can’t tell if there’s a one-time fee involved or a subscription. We saw something similar to this a few months ago, except that one involved SMS sign-ups to enter a competition for a pair of binoculars.
There’s no prize on offer here except the warm, fuzzy feeling one receives shortly after realising they’ve been completely and utterly fleeced.
Don’t fall for it.
