Recently, cybercriminals launched yet another massive spam campaign, this time impersonating the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in an attempt to trick tax payers into clicking on a link pointing to a bogus Microsoft Word Document. Once the user clicks on it, they are redirected to a Black Hole exploit kit landing URL, where they’re exposed to the client-side exploits served by the kit.
More details:

Screenshot of the spamvertised IRS themed email:

Once the user clicks on the link pointing to a Black Hole landing URL, he’s exposed to the following bogus “Page loading…” page:

Spamvertised URLs: hxxp://tiraccontolamusica.it/reves.html; hxxp://marcina.pl//reves.html; hxxp://juegosinternet.org/reves.html; hxxp://breastenlargementratings.com/reves.html
Client-side exploits serving URL: hxxp://retweetadministrator.org/main.php?page=8b45f871830c6e5a
Client-side exploits served: CVE-2010-0188; CVE-2010-1885
Detection rate for a sample redirection script: MD5: 1ab7543c3c7857eec5014b3de5da362e detected by 3 out of 41 antivirus scanners as JS/Iframe.W!tr; Trojan-Downloader.JS.Iframe.czj.
Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 6d7b7d2409626f2c8c166373e5ef76a5 on the affected hosts, currently detected by 30 out of 41 antivirus scanners as Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Gimemo.akxc
Also, as you can see in the first screenshot, the cybercriminals behind the campaign didn’t bother to use the services of a “cultural diversity on demand” underground market proposition offering the ability to localize a message or a web site to the native language of the prospective victim, hence they failed to properly formulate their sentence, thereby raising suspicion in the eyes of the prospective victim.
