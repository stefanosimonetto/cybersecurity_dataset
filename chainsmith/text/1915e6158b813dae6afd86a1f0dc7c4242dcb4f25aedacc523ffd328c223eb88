Facebook Red Rides Again
Facebook colour change scams never die, they just return with a fresh coat of paint (assuming the paint is red, or even yellow if you’re particularly lucky). Favourite primary colours aside, we have another Facebook colour / theme changer to add to the pile of discarded artwork in the corner. The URL in question is
appfbviral(dot)com/theme(dot)php

Hitting the continue button brings up an App install prompt for something called Change F_B Look Now.

Note that the page says “this does not let the app post to Facebook“, so they’ll need to ask the person doing the installing to tell others about it.

Anybody wanting to see the mythical Facebook Red will have to deal with a survey page. Everybody else should just not bother, and be content changing their profiles on sites which allow customisation of the kind these Facebook Red scams endlessly promise. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to find out what happens when you mix 50% blue, 33% red and 17% brown (it’s a sort of weird lavender thing, in case you were wondering).
