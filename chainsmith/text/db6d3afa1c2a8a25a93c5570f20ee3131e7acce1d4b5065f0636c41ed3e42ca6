7.400 Download & Important Install Information – Please read the following carefully!
The Astaro Up2Date technology makes it easy to upgrade your installation to the latest version. The moment your device obtains a download slot, the Up2Date will be automatically downloaded, verified, and made available for installation. Depending on your location and bandwidth, this could take up to 72 hours from initial launch due to the size and scale of this release.
It is NOT necessary to do anything in order to obtain 7.400, however if you are excited to install the new release ASAP, there are two ways to manually download an Up2Date package for the system so it can be imported to WebAdmin and applied.
New ISO’s are also being made available for Software, Appliances, and the Astaro Smart Installer.

A Word About Memory Upgrades
As mentioned previously, ASG 110/120, 220, and 320 appliances can take advantage of our recently released RAM upgrade options, which will give more life and performance out of your investment. While upgrading is NOT required or enforced in order to install and operate Version 7.400, some appliances depending on their current usage may get significant benefits by taking advantage of this offer. For more information on available upgrades, please contact your Astaro Partner, Distributor, or Sales Contact. We have also made available a serial number submission page to assist you, which will quickly analyze the number of your unit(s) and inform you of the upgrade options.
Feedback
If you want to provide feedback or want to discuss any of the V7 features you should post it on our User Bulletin Board. Please take care to add always(!) the version you refer to (e.g. "[7.400] Quarantine Report "). If you have feedback to our documentation (Online Help) please send it to docu@astaro.com. There is also a demo server that showcases all the new awesomeness: http://demo.astaro.com All Up2Dates are GNUPG-signed! Enjoy the new things!
