Astaro would like to clarify that the 5.003 version of Astaro Security Linux, available on Up2Date 5.003, is Release Candidate #3, not the General Availability Release. RC3 will be split in 2 Up2Date packages for technical reasons, this means that 2 Up2Dates will be released today 5.002 and 5.003 and they both belong to RC3.

The GA version will follow soon and it will be 5.005. ASL 5.005 includes some kernel updates  and require a reboot. It will be availiable as an Up2Date and as an ISO image.
This release candidate fixes a number of problems reported for Release Candidate #2. As with the previous candidate release, 5.003 is suitable for testing, for home use, and for basic production environments. However, corporate customers with large or complex configurations should test the release in their labs before deployment.
Please watch this bulletin board for announcements about the upcoming General Availability Release.
