Network up2date

Version 6.300 includes some highlights: performance improvments for IPS and Anti-Virus of more than 50%, deletion of NTLM credentials and two new SMTP recipient white lists (global or just for Anti-Spam). And it includes of course also many bug fixes – read on to get the details…

SMTP recipient whitelists
There are two new whitelist: one in the spam section to exclude recipients from spam check and a global whitelist to exclude recipients from all checks (even from virus scanning):

Performance improvments for IPS and Anti-Virus
We optimized the search algorithm for IPS engine, with only 10MB of additional RAM usage, the perforce increases by more than 50%. This optimization is only enabled for machines with more than 256 MB RAM. We are also introducing the Astaro Anti-Virus engine for a faster Secure Web and Secure Email.
NTLM credentials deletion
We fixed this long term and displeasing issue,  you are now able to disable NTLM, which than will delete the old credentials. This enables you to rejoin again or to a  new Active Directory. Please remember to delete the ASG system account on your Domain Controller with the Administrative Tool ”Active Directory Users and Computers„ to also remove all ASG entries in the AD.
