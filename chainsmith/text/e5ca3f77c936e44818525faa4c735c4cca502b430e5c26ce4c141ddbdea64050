Joomla! 3.3.5 Released – Fixing High Priority Security Issues

Update: It seems like there is a glitch in the new version and the Joomla team is urging its users not to upgrade yet. From their Twitter:

Original post:
The Joomla team just released versions 3.3.5, 3.2.6 and 2.5.26, patching high priority security issues. The first one is an Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability and the second one is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability that affect all previous versions. If you are using Joomla, stop what you are doing and update it now!
The good news for our clients and what’s very exciting for us, me especially, is to see how the virtual hardening on our CloudProxy Website firewall protected our clients automatically against this vulnerability. As our researchers started to analyze the disclosure, we quickly noticed that it was already covered and the URL used to trigger this bug was already blocked by default. It means that our clients got zero-day protection without anyone even knowing about this issue.
For more information on these vulnerabilities, you can get straight from the Joomla! release notes:
