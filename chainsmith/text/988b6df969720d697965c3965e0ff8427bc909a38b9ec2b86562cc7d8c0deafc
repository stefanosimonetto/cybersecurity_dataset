Did you know VMware Workstation ships with a sniffer?  I should have know about it before now.  Lenny Zeltser mentioned it in his 2001 paper on reverse engineering malware.  There's only 15 references in Google Groups, however.Vnetsniffer is very limited with regard to reporting.  Here is sample output:C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Workstation>vnetsnifferusage: vnetsniffer [/e] (/p "pvnID" | VMnet?)C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Workstation>runas /u:administrator "vnetsniffer /e vmnet0"Enter password for administrator:Attempting to start "vnetsniffer /e vmnet0" as user "administrator"...len  203 src 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c dst 00:13:10:65:2f:ab IP src 192.168.2.4     dst 208.185.174.52  TCPlen   60 src 00:13:10:65:2f:ab dst 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c ARP sender 00:13:10:65:2f:ab 192.168.2.1     target 00:00:00:00:00:00 192.168.2.4    ARP requestlen   42 src 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c dst 00:13:10:65:2f:ab ARP sender 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c 192.168.2.4     target 00:13:10:65:2f:ab 192.168.2.1      ARP replylen  203 src 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c dst 00:13:10:65:2f:ab IP src 192.168.2.4      dst 208.185.174.52  TCPlen  342 src 00:0c:29:22:b7:2d dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff IP src 0.0.0.0         dst 255.255.255.255 UDPlen  203 src 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c dst 00:13:10:65:2f:ab IP src 192.168.2.4      dst 208.185.174.52  TCPlen  342 src 00:0c:29:22:b7:2d dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff IP src 0.0.0.0         dst 255.255.255.255 UDPlen  342 src 00:0c:29:22:b7:2d dst ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff IP src 0.0.0.0         dst 255.255.255.255 UDPlen  203 src 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c dst 00:13:10:65:2f:ab IP src 192.168.2.4      dst 208.185.174.52  TCPlen  435 src 00:13:10:65:2f:ab dst 00:03:47:0f:1f:3c IP src 208.185.174.52   dst 192.168.2.4     TCPThis output doesn't even show TCP or UDP ports, which would be very helpful.  Vnetsniffer seems best suited for basic troubleshooting of virtual switches, thanks to the ability to specify a vmnet to monitor.  Here I chose vmnet0, which is the default bridged interface.  vmnet1 is used for host-only networking, and vmnet8 is used for NAT.
