W32.Korgo.A is a worm that attempts to exploit Microsoft LSASS Windows vulnerability, described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-011.
At a certain point all of these worms going after one vulnerability gets kind of old. Its kind of like shooting ducks in a barrel isnâ€™t it? Anyone still not patched kind of deserves what they get if they ignored the first worm.
