As indicated last week, we have released updated images for Hardware, Software, and VMware virtual appliances. These allow you to install fresh Astaro Security Gateways at our most current production version of ASG V8.102. We have also added a VMware vSphere 4 image which includes new tools and support for VMware’s latest ESX V4.x platforms. Direct download links and further information are inside.

Astaro provides many options for installing on our own official hardware, your provided hardware, or your virtual VMware installation. Please be sure you get the correct image for what you are wanting to install on/with. For example, there are three 8.102 ISO images for ASG Hardware appliances, one normal ISO (for burning to CD or using in a non-VMware virtualization product), and one for each version of the Astaro Smart Installer which allows you to install images using a special USB drive that contains a CD-Rom emulation chip.
*Please note that the Astaro Smart Installer is not a normal USB stick and you will not be able to burn one of those images to a non-ASI device.
