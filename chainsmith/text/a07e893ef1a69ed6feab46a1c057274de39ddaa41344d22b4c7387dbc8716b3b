Amazon.com blacklisted by SpamHaus XBL

Update: Spamhaus contact us to let us know that they removed amazon from the blacklist and are investigating the issue.
SPAMHAUS has various blacklists and one of them is the XBL:
“The Spamhaus Exploits Block List (XBL) is a realtime database of IP addresses of hijacked PCs infected by illegal 3rd party exploits, including open proxies (HTTP, socks, AnalogX, wingate, etc), worms/viruses with built-in spam engines, and other types of trojan-horse exploits.”
Well, this morning I got this notification from Sucuri Internet Monitor:
29c29,30<    OK: Host www.amazon.com clean.—>    WARN: http://www.spamhaus.org/query/bl?ip=72.21.207.65>    WARN: Host www.amazon.com blacklisted.
First I thought that something was wrong, but then I double checked:
$ host www.amazon.comwww.amazon.com has address 72.21.207.65
And if I visit I see that it is still blacklisted: http://www.spamhaus.org/query/bl?ip=72.21.207.65I assume it is a false positive… Anyone know more information?
