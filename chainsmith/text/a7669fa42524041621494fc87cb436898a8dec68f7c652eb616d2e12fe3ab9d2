Twitter defacement

It is all over the news today that Twitter was defaced yesterday. Lots of speculation regarding what happened, but that’s the alert I received yesterday from Sucuri Network Monitor:
Sucuri nbim: twitter.com DNS modified
Modifications:3a4< twitter.com has address 128.121.146.100< twitter.com has address 168.143.162.52> twitter.com has address 66.147.242.88—This alert was generated by the Sucuri Network Integrity Monitor. Log in to your dashboard at http://sucuri.net.
So we can see that it was indeed a DNS redirection attack and that probably their servers weren’t attacked directly.
If you are curious were they are hosting their DNS, here it is:
Domain Name: TWITTER.COM Registrar: NETWORK SOLUTIONS, LLC.   Whois Server: whois.networksolutions.com   Referral URL: http://www.networksolutions.com   Name Server: NS1.P26.DYNECT.NET   Name Server: NS2.P26.DYNECT.NET   Name Server: NS3.P26.DYNECT.NET   Name Server: NS4.P26.DYNECT.NET   Status: clientTransferProhibited   Updated Date: 27-may-2009   Creation Date: 21-jan-2000   Expiration Date: 21-jan-2018
If you tried to access their services last night, we recommend changing your password ASAP. If you want to monitor your own domain names for this kind of issue (for free), visit http://sucuri.net
