The stresses and strains of the previous comparative &ndash; featuring a record number of participants on the shiny new <em class="productname">Windows 7</em> platform &ndash; are gradually fading to a glorious, if rather painful memory, while the prospect looms of the <em class="productname">XP</em> comparative in the spring, which promises an even larger field of products to slog through. Sandwiched between these two behemoths, the <em class="productname">Linux</em> test provides a welcome moment of respite.</p><p>With far fewer products available for the <em class="productname">Linux</em> platform than for most others we test on, we always expect a quiet month, but it appeared from the start that our choice of distribution would make for an even smaller test than anticipated. Although <em class="phrase">Novell</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">SUSE Linux</em> is one of the most well funded and heavily marketed commercial server distributions, and its most recent edition (version 11) was released some nine months prior to the test deadline, it still presented enough of a challenge to put off entries from several of those normally expected to take part in our tests. The two largest security firms, <em class="phrase">Symantec</em> and <em class="phrase">McAfee</em>, were unable to provide products supporting the platform, although <em class="phrase">Symantec</em> promises a new edition with full support due for release very soon.</p><p>Several others also decided not to take part due to timing issues and new releases pending.</p><p>Another major vendor also opted to skip this test, again with a significant upgrade to its Linux product close on the horizon but not quite ready for testing. This decision marks something of the end of an era: <span class="emphasis"><em>VB</em></span> has been running VB100 comparative reviews since January 1998, more or less every two months, with a total of 67 sets of results published so far &ndash; this month&rsquo;s test will be the first time that <em class="phrase">Kaspersky Lab</em> has not submitted a product. A sad day indeed.</p><p>However, some nine products did make their way to us in time for the test deadline, with most of the remaining regular participants present and no further surprises. Small numbers do not necessarily make for a simple test of course, and previous experience of <em class="productname">Linux</em> tests has led us to expect all manner of opaque and confusing installation procedures, unusual and esoteric implementation and incomplete, inadequate and even well-hidden documentation. Hoping for a smooth and simple test (but as always prepared for the worst), we settled ourselves into the test lab for what was guaranteed to be an interesting month.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3995927"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Novell</em>&rsquo;s acquisition of the <em class="productname">SUSE</em> distribution, announced in 2003 and finalized in early 2004, brought <em class="productname">SUSE</em> to the highest level of commercially supported <em class="productname">Linux</em> flavours. Always among the market leaders in Europe, it now stands as one of few likely challengers for <em class="productname">Red Hat</em> in the business sector. Successive releases have brought ever greater stability, completeness of vision and ease of use. The slick installer and the advanced Yast configuration tool bring most tasks involved in setting up and running a system, desktop or server within the grasp of even the most modest administrator. The platform has long been a favourite in the <span class="emphasis"><em>VB</em></span> lab, with the fully open source variant <em class="productname">OpenSUSE</em> running on many of the servers that support our test networks. The more sober server edition is also the platform of choice for our anti-spam test network, and is selected by default if solution providers have no preference. So the task of preparing the test systems was a straightforward one. Installing and cloning systems was a fast and easy process, and few adjustments were required beyond pointing a few network shares to the right places and sharing the storage areas for the test sets ready for on-access testing. A client system, running <em class="productname">Windows XP SP3</em>, was set up with these shares mounted as network drives, with the standard set of scripts to run the on-access tests, and things were ready to go.</p><p>Putting the test sets in place proved similarly free from problems. The latest additions to the WildList were reasonably unremarkable, with yet more Koobface and OnlineGames variants continuing to dominate the list, and the old guard &ndash; the reams of Netsky and Mytob variants which once held sway over the list &ndash; continuing to decline. The most significant items on the list remain the complex W32/Virut strains, of which yet another new variant was added in recent months; as usual, our automated replicator churned out several thousand examples ready to challenge the products&rsquo; detection abilities to the utmost.</p><p>Elsewhere in the test sets everything was much as normal. The trojan set was slightly larger than usual thanks to a longer than average gap since the last test and some further expansion of our sample-gathering efforts. Meanwhile, the RAP sets were kept to a reasonable size thanks to a notable decrease in the number of incoming samples over the Christmas and New Year period, when most of the samples were taken in (probably due to various labs taking time off over the festive season); numbers quickly climbed back to previous levels a few weeks into 2010, with many sources providing extra large bundles to catch up with backlogs.</p><p>The speed sets were left largely unchanged, other than a little cleaning of inappropriate files which had slipped in, and the clean set had a fairly average number of additions, most of which were popular freeware utilities and some software provided free with magazines and hardware acquired by the lab in recent months. A dedicated set of <em class="productname">Linux</em> files was also compiled for the speed tests, taken from the /bin, /sbin, /etc, /opt and /usr folders of one of the test machines. As usual for the speed tests, scanning speeds using both default settings and &lsquo;full&rsquo; settings were recorded &ndash; where necessary, settings were increased to include all file types with no size limit, scanning archives internally to the highest available depth. A product&rsquo;s times were counted in the full column if files with non-standard extensions were detected and, for the archive set, if at least four of the eight archive types checked were scanned to a depth of at least four levels. Thanks to the fair number of compressed files in the <em class="productname">Linux</em> speed set, this was treated in the same way as the archive set for this month&rsquo;s test.</p><p>With everything set up and more or less in order, we got down to business.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2375384"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4346840"></a>Alwil avast! for Linux 3.2.0_rc</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Alwil</em>&rsquo;s product was provided as a selection of RPM installer files, along with some instructions on compiling and installing the <em class="productname">Dazuko</em> filtering module required by the on-access scanner. Several steps were required, but thanks to the clear instructions everything ran through smoothly and we were soon underway with our first run through the tests.</p><p>Running of scans from the command line and operation of the on-access guard proved logical and simple, following pretty simple and predictable formats, and with decent speeds across all sets, results were gathered in pleasingly short order. Detection rates were as excellent as ever, with scanning speeds even more impressive in both modes. No problems were encountered in the WildList or any of the clean sets, and <em class="phrase">Alwil</em> is duly awarded another VB100 for its collection.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/02/Alwil-RAP-Feb10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>92.60%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.39%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3319455"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3516104"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2880934"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3292390"></a>Avira AntiVir Linux Server Professional 3.0.5</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Avira</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Linux</em> solution uses the <em class="productname">Dazuko</em> filter module in a slightly different fashion, but provides it pre-compiled and ready to go with just a minor tweak required to one of the set-up scripts.

Operation and control of the product is thus straightforward, and with good speeds throughout, testing once again took little time or effort.</p><p>Some truly superb detection figures were achieved, nearing perfection in the trojans set and pretty impressive in the RAP sets.

A GUI is provided, accessible from a built-in web server, which closely resembles that seen in numerous <em class="productname">Windows</em> tests over the last few years. This proved to offer all the functions required, but not in great depth and without the finer control provided by command-line and configuration file set-ups &ndash; the preferred method of more serious <em class="productname">Linux</em> admins, particularly at the server level. A command-line tool for on-demand scanning is provided, but seemed unwilling to work for us without deeper research, so we mostly made do with the GUI. This proved a rather frustrating path, as the interface was flaky in the extreme, with around one click in five (and sometimes as many as one in three) producing a page error and requiring a refresh of the browser and a retry at configuring. Nevertheless, we got there in the end, with the only lasting problem being an apparent lack of archive scanning on access despite options to enable it in the interface &ndash; a problem we have noted many times previously with the <em class="productname">Windows</em> version of the same product.</p><p>Speeds were as excellent as we have come to expect from <em class="phrase">CA</em>&rsquo;s remarkably quick engine, and while detection rates in the trojans and RAP sets were rather disappointing, no problems were encountered in the WildList set and no false positives turned up in the clean sets, thus qualifying <em class="phrase">CA</em> for a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2010/02/CA-RAP-Feb10.gif" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>47.52%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>92.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4496040"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2851943"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4604287"></a></h3></div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3456812"></a>eScan for Linux File Servers 3.3.-3.sles11</h3></div></div></div><p>The <em class="productname">Linux</em> version of <em class="productname">eScan</em> is another complete and professional server package, again with a web-accessible GUI as well as a desktop interface for running on-demand scans, but where possible we went with the command line to enable better automation of tasks. Installation was fairly painless, with a set of RPM installers to run and the on-access protection provided on <em class="productname">Samba</em> shares with some small additions to make to the <em class="productname">Samba</em> configuration file. All of this is clearly documented in an accompanying PDF manual.</p><p>Scanning speeds were not the fastest, partly thanks to some very thorough default settings, but detection rates seemed generally good. However, on checking the results we found a number of unexpected misses in the WildList and worms and bots sets, with files not spotted on access but easily noted on demand. Deeper analysis showed that the on-access scanner is set to ignore files larger than 2048KB by default &ndash; presumably to mitigate slowdowns caused by the thorough scanning.

We saw slow scanning times and heavy on-access lags, although most products were reasonably lightweight and nimble. We saw some disappointing detection rates alongside some highly impressive scores. Having expected a high pass rate &ndash; perhaps even a clean sweep &ndash; we saw problems with false positives, missed polymorphic samples in the WildList set, and an unfortunate default setting causing products to miss the required standard for the award. All in all, a bit of a mixed bag.</p><p>A few interesting trends and patterns were noted. Unlike most of our tests on the <em class="productname">Windows</em> platform, where on-demand scores are almost invariably higher than those recorded on access, we saw several products doing less well with their on-demand scans. This, of course, is due to the way the products are operated, with command-line scanners often defaulting to less thorough defaults than graphical ones, giving the operator more freedom and control to design scans as required. In the <em class="productname">Linux</em> context, the concept of &lsquo;default&rsquo; is perhaps a little less exact than in most of our tests, although of course all scanners have their own list of automatically enabled options.</p><p>The RAP tests produced some interesting results once again, with most products taking up familiar positions in the RAP quadrant. As our automation systems improve we are slowly increasing the size of the RAP sets, as well as fine-tuning their correlation with prevalence and telemetry data and thus their relevance, and hopefully this will continue to increase the value of the data provided.</p><p>We also hope soon to implement a long-planned series of improvements in the polymorphic and worms-and-bots sets, as well as the redesign and rebuilding of our clean, speed and false positive sets. Much of this should be in place in time for the next test &ndash; for which we expect a vastly expanded field of products, including a number of newcomers.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4704742"></a>Technical details</h2></div></div></div><p><b>Test environment.&nbsp;</b>All products were tested on identical systems with <em class="productname">AMD Athlon64 X2</em> Dual Core 5200+ processors, 2GB RAM, dual 80GB and 400GB hard drives.
