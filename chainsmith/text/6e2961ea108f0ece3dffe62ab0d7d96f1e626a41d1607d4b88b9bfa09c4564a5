We have just intercepted yet another spamvertised malware serving campaign, this time impersonating Vodafone U.K, in an attempt to trick the company’s customers into thinking that they’ve received an image. In reality, once users execute the malicious attachments, their PCs automatically join the botnet operated by the cybercriminal.
More details:

Detection rate for the malicious executable – MD5: 4e148480749937acef8a7d9bc0b3c8b5 – detected by 25 out of 47 antivirus scanners as VirTool:Win32/Obfuscator.ACP; Backdoor.Win32.Androm.sed.
Once executed, the sample creates an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) – C:Documents and SettingsUserApplication Datadbgbsheshabeegeg.exe:Zone.Identifier, as well as installs itself at Windows startup.
It then creates the following files on the affected hosts:
C:Documents and SettingsUserApplication Datadbgbsheshabeegeg.exe
C:DOCUME~1UserLOCALS~1TempIMG.JPEG.exe
C:WINDOWSRegistrationR000000000007.clb
C:WINDOWSsystem32wbemwbemdisp.TLB
And the following Mutexes:

It then phones back to the following C&C server:
