XSS on oswd.org (Open source Web design) used by spammers

http://www.oswd.org/ (Open Source design) is a popular web site used for sharing templates and web designs. They have a strong and active community and we actually used that in the past when looking for templates.
However, we started to notice lately a lot of spammers using the oswd.org site for hosting their content. Instead of having links to a viagra or a cialis web site, they were linking directly to random oswd profiles. For example:
http://www.oswd.org/user/profile/id/52781 or http://www.oswd.org/user/profile/id/52780 orhttp://www.oswd.org/user/profile/id/52792
*There are hundreds of profiles within the 526-528 range being used for that. If you search on twitter for “user profile” “oswd” you will find a bunch as well.
As we dug deeper, we found out the reason: Every designer can specify their site and a link to their portfolio. However their input form has a XSS flaw, that allowed the attackers to specify iframes within the link:

src="http://googpillmm.com/lucyloaai-mmrxaeixnv.py"src="http://googpillmm.com/nzmvlijaqi8jjou0bfuks.html

So, instead of adding the link, the attackers used ya.ru followed the iframe. Any user that visited these pages would load the spam (or malware) automatically from there.
We already contacted oswd.org and hopefully they will fix it soon and remove the spammers.
