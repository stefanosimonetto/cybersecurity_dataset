Some interesting trackback spam

I was reviewing my trackback spam. Yes, I review what the system calls spam just to make sure no legitimate content gets sidetracked. Some of the spam had links to a Radford Professor’s website. If you followed the link to the University site, and you have javascript enabled, you’ll find yourself immediately redirected to a porn site (not located on the Radford server).
If the spammer had half a brain, he would have social engineered people much better than that. First make it look like a real post. A comment or trackback with tons of links is not going to get through. Second, instead of obvious spam content, the trackback could be a bit more relevant to what is posted. Since the spammer is 0wning a legit domain like Radford.edu use that value. People will trust it more than a link to sexsexsex.more
