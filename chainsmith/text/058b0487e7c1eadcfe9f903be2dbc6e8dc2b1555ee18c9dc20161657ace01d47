Network up2date

We have released Up2Date 7.507 for ASG installations to address an issue around Unix Time which can affect the use of certificates, and thus your ASG installation. This up2date package should be applied before the end of August if possible.

ASG uses certificates for different purposes (such as for each user that is created) and CAs (certificate authorities) for signing the certificates mentioned before. When performing the initial setup, some CAs as well as the admin certificate are generated.
When passing a certain point in time the theoretical end-date for our certs and CAs is beyond 19 January 2038 which will cause trouble to the system as the end-date of a cert/CA must not be before the start-date.
*SUMMARY NOTICE*
Any and all systems which have this up2date applied before the end of August 2010 will be completely free from troubles or consequences as a result of this global Linux/Unix issue. If you apply it, you can avoid needing to educate yourself further.
For units which are not updated before then, we will issue a single fix for this bug via a specially crafted pattern Up2Date as well, which will be automatically patched/applied without updating the firmware version.
If you would like more education on this issue, you can read more about it here via Wikipediaâ€™s entry: Year 2038 problem.
