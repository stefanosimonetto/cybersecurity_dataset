Introducing alternative strings and a tool of true tools

Business is a world of words. Politics is a world of nuances.  The very same principle applies to data analysis – strings are readable, and alternative strings are readable alternatively. Given the fact the alternative strings have never been paid attention to, I introduce a new script that aims at fixing this issue.
The alt-strings.pl script is written in perl and is very simple to use. All you need to do is to run it using the following syntax:

perl alt-strings.pl <filename>

The resulting output is very easy to interpret – here are two examples:

Running the script using its own code as an input shows a number of neglected blank characters:

Running the script on calc.exe – note the ‘frozen’ color of the window which indicates the next-gen AI algorithm is broadcasting the bells and other weird characters to the user making the analysis great again
