Website Hijinks Part 4

Posted by Roger on 8 May 2005, 8:40 pm

I got back from a motherâ€™s day trip, and I see that tgp.laâ€™s registrar has given them the kaibosh.
http://whois.dotregistrar.com/drs/wwwhois.pl?domain=tgp&tld=.LA&Check=Check
Status:PENDING DELETE RESTORABLE
Status:HOLD
Also the glue records that were in place on the root servers is gone. I dont want to be premature here, but I think weâ€™ve stopped the tgp.la hijack. ðŸ™‚
I suspect the hackerâ€™s next step will be to attempt to remodify all the home pages on powweb. With tgp.la offline and unlikely to return, theyâ€™ll need a new domain for a new attack.
