IMLogic is reporting a new IM worm using the wmf vulnerability. This is currently related as low.
If you’ve got IMLogic, you’re cool. Otherwise you might want to wach access to 168.169.78.19 cause the file is live. Oh, I hear the file is detected with the Symantec bloodhound defs, but I didn’t want to test that for myself.
