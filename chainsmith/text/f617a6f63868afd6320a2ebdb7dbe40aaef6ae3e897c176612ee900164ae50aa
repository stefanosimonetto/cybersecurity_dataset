Executing unsigned code is very easy when you have a signed .exe loading a DLL with a predetermined file name.
This is a case of a Dellâ€™s Viewer Executable that expects to see a DLL named <file>retv.dll in the same directory where it is placed. Launching the .exe loads and executes the DLL immediately, e.g. using a pair of signed test.exe + unsigned testretv.dll.
