Google blacklisted all the .cz.cc domains

It seems that Google just blacklisted all the sites under the .cz.cc main domain (including the nic.cz.cc, start.cz.cc and all others). In their status page Google says:

Has this site acted as an intermediary resulting in further distribution of malware?

Over the past 90 days, cz.cc appeared to function as an intermediary for the infection of 13788 site(s) including uniform-net.jp/, nuxi-navi.com/, flashracingonline.com/.

Has this site hosted malware?

Yes, this site has hosted malicious software over the past 90 days. It infected 47193 domain(s), including razym.ru/, discuss.com.hk/, lnk.by/.

So according to Google, they infected more than 47 thousand domains. It is interesting because in the last few months the .cc TLD has been the most used by attackers, but it seems that Google decided to just blacklist everything (probably by mistake).
You can see this warning, by checking the status page on google for any site ending in .cz.cc: http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http://anysite.cz.cc/ :

What is the current listing status for cz.cc?
Site is listed as suspicious â€“ visiting this web site may harm your computer.
Part of this site was listed for suspicious activity 2907 time(s) over the past 90 days.

We will post more details if we learn back from Google.
