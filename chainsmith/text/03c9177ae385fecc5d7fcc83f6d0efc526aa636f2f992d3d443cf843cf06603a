My CCNA class did not cover this, but I think it is important to enable SSH version 2 on Cisco gear that supports it.  You can use the Cisco Software Advisor to find IOS images that support the Secure Shell Server version 2 feature.  Once you have an appropriate image loaded, follow these instructions to get your SSH v2 server running.  Here's what I did:gill(config)#hostname gillgill(config)#ip domain-name taosecurity.comgill(config)#crypto key generate rsaChoose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to 2048 for your  General Purpose Keys. Choosing a key modulus greater than 512 may take  a few minutes.How many bits in the modulus [512]: 1024% Generating 1024 bit RSA keys ...[OK]gill(config)#ip ssh time-out 60gill(config)#ip ssh authentication-retries 3gill(config)#ip ssh version 2gill(config-line)#login localgill(config-line)#transport input sshgill(config-line)#exitgill(config)#username me privilege 15 password mypasswordgill(config)#endHere are a few notes.  First, choose a key bigger than 512 bits.  When I tried this the first time and accepted the default, I got this error message from my FreeBSD OpenSSH client:ssh_rsa_verify: RSA modulus too small: 512 < minimum 768 bitskey_verify failed for server_host_keySecond, you'll see I specified 'login local'.  This means I have to create a user (here, 'me') to allow connection to the SSH daemon.  If I just said 'login', I'd have to enter the console password.Third, I did not really need to specify a hostname in this example, since it was already set.  I did so to show how to do it.Last, Cisco's documentation recommends 'ip ssh timeout 60' when the real syntax is 'ip ssh time-out 60'.I recommend running SSH v2 as SSH v1 is susceptible to various attacks.When you connect to the server, your client will see this:debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version Cisco-1.25debug1: no match: Cisco-1.25debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0On the router, try the 'show ssh' command to see active sessions:gill#sh sshConnection Version Mode Encryption  Hmac         State                 Username0          2.0     IN   aes128-cbc  hmac-md5     Session started       me0          2.0     OUT  aes128-cbc  hmac-md5     Session started       me%No SSHv1 server connections running.
