Network up2date

Our Beta community will be excited to hear that we have just made available the third package in our 7.500 release testing. This Up2Date draws heavily on the feedback from our Beta Testing Forum. Weâ€™ve made improvements to features, cleaned up a lot of areas to make them more production-ready, and advanced the quality and speed of of the entire release.

Due to the way our Beta infrastructure is organized and separated from the production/GA release network, this Up2Date package may take a while for your ASG to acquire fully. Any download slowness or delays in the package propagating to your Beta-test are due to this reason only, and when the GA version launches it will use the full power of our content distribution network. You can read on for the full details of this Beta Up2date!  At around 175 Megabytes in size, its a very large Up2Date, so please be patient as it distributes.
We have made improvements to SSL VPN, WebAdmin, HTTP Proxy, Reporting, and the Flow Monitor, along with most other areas of the Beta.  This release is available both as an Up2Date download package from 7.460 (Beta 2), as well as a full ISO image for both ASG appliances and software installs on your own hardware platform. Feel free to join us in the Beta using these options, or you can re-install at any time with the latest Beta version and restore a backup from any 7.40x or Beta 7.5 release for continued testing.
Please note:
If you are already testing the 7.460 Beta release, your installation will automatically download the Up2Date and make it available to install via WebAdmin. You do not need to download this package manually (unless you wish to).
