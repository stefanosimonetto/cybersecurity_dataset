Cybercriminals are mass mailing tens of thousands of malicious Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) themed emails, in an attempt to trick users into clicking on the client-side exploits serving and malware dropping URLs found in the bogus emails. Let’s dissect the campaign, expose the portfolio of malicious domains using it, provide MD5s for a sample exploit and the dropped malware, as well as connect the campaign with previously launched already profiled malicious campaigns.
