Cybercriminals are currently spamvertising two separate campaigns, impersonating Facebook Inc., in an attempt to trick its users into thinking that their Facebook account has been disabled. What these two campaigns have in common is the fact that the client-side exploits serving domains are both parked on the same IP. Once users click on any of the links found in the malicious emails, they’re exposed to the client-side exploits served by the Black Hole Exploit Kit.
More details:

We’ve already seen and profiled the same domain used in the following malicious campaign:

‘Your Kindle e-book Amazon receipt’ themed emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit

Detection rate for the malicious PDF payload:
MD5: e415fbe2bad61491b4314618ae57e2c5 – detected by 25 out of 46 antivirus scanners as Exploit:Win32/Pdfjsc.AEW

Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: a2fe9b8154b28c8b7b7f898924276b8c – detected by 23 out of 46 antivirus scanners as Worm:Win32/Cridex.E.
Upon execution, the sample creates the following process on the affected hosts:
%AppData%kb00121600.exe
It then creates the following Mutexes:
LocalXMM000003F8
LocalXMRFB119394
LocalXMM000005E4
LocalXMM0000009C
LocalXMM000000C8

REGISTRYUSERS-1-5-21-299502267-926492609-1801674531-500SoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCBA6D3F36
Once executed, the sample also phones back to the following C&C (command and control servers):
hxxp://88.119.156.20:8080/AJtw/UCyqrDAA/Ud+asDAA/
hxxp://173.201.177.77/J9/vp//EGa+AAAAAA/2MB9vCAAAA/

hxxp://203.114.112.156/asp/intro.php
We’ve already seen the same pseudo-randm C&C communication characters (EGa+AAAAAA), as well as the same C&C server (173.201.177.77) in the following previously profiled campaigns:

‘Your Kindle e-book Amazon receipt’ themed emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit

‘Batch Payment File Declined’ EFTPS themed emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit
Fake ‘ADP Speedy Notifications’ lead to client-side exploits and malware
