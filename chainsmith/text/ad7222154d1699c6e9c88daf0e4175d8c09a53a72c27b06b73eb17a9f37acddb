This is a note for myself, so if you're looking for uber-security insights today, please skip this post.  If you do stick with me and you can suggest ways to do this better, please share your comments.Earlier this year I posted TaoSecurity CVS at Sourceforge and Committing Changes to CVS.  Since posting my Sguil on FreeBSD scripts at TaoSecurity Sourceforge I needed to make a few changes.  The system hosting my original files suffered a lightning strike, so I decided to retrieve the files from CVS and make changes.Checking out the scripts can be done anonymously without a password.  (Note there are some artificial line breaks in these and other lines.)$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@taosecurity.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/taosecurity loginLogging in to :pserver:anonymous@taosecurity.cvs.sourceforge.net:2401 /cvsroot/taosecurityCVS password: $ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@taosecurity.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/taosecurity  co -P taosecurity_sguil_scriptscvs checkout: Updating taosecurity_sguil_scriptsU taosecurity_sguil_scripts/README...truncated...When I checked out these files they had headers like this:# $Id: README,v 1.2 2007/03/22 18:40:25 taosecurity Exp $ #These headers are added by lines like this from the original files:# $Id$ #In order to turn these new checked out files into files that would have the proper headers, I replaced these specific lines in each file with the tag # $Id$ #.I added several files to the scripts, but for purposes of documentation I'll show how I added one -- sguild_start.sh.  I had to connect via SSH to do this.$ export CVS_RSH=ssh$ cvs -d:ext:user@taosecurity.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/taosecurity  add sguild_start.sh user@taosecurity.cvs.sf.net's password: cvs add: scheduling file `sguild_start.sh' for additioncvs add: use 'cvs commit' to add this file permanently$ cvs -d:ext:user@taosecurity.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/taosecurity  commit sguild_start.sh user@taosecurity.cvs.sf.net's password: RCS file: /cvsroot/taosecurity/taosecurity_sguil_scripts/sguild_start.sh,vdoneChecking in sguild_start.sh;/cvsroot/taosecurity/taosecurity_sguil_scripts/sguild_start.sh,v  <--  sguild_start.shinitial revision: 1.1doneI think I could have set a CVSROOT variable instead of specifying everything on the command line, perhaps like:$ export CVSROOT=:ext:user@taosecurity.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/taosecuritySetting that I could ignore the entire -d switch.When I add or commit files I could add a -m "Comment" line to describe the change.Currently my scripts assume installation using FreeBSD 6.2, using the packages in the packages-6.2-release directory.  The only exception is the package for tcltls because it was not shipped with 6.2.
