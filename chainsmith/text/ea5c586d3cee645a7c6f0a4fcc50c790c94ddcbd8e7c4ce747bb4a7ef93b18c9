Network up2date

A few security vulnerabilities have been posted which require us to make an update to our V7 installations. Since we do not put our users at extended risk by following a scheduled update window, we are releasing this special Up2Date immediately. This V7.509 Up2date is soley issued in order to patch two components, and no new features are introduced. If you have been awaiting the release of ASG V7.509 so that you may migrate to V8.100 on your ASG appliance via our one-touch process, note that this is still on schedule but will be released under the V7.510 label. For some more dates around the GA release of V8.100 and the subsequent 7.510 click on "Read More".

Currently V8.100 is in soft-release, we plan to issue the GA Up2Date push on approximately January 11th. Following that, we’ll soft-release the 7.510 Up2Date during the week of January 20th. This will then provide all qualifying ASG appliances with a one-touch upgrade to V8.100.
UpDate 7.509 Details
This Up2Date should be applied as soon as possible. Note that in most cases you do not need to manually download this, as the Up2Date will be pushed over our distribution system. The ASG Soft-Release process is not used for Up2Dates which are for security patching, for obvious reasons.
Remarks:

Configuration will not be upgraded
System will be rebooted

Address clam vulnerability

Fixes:
