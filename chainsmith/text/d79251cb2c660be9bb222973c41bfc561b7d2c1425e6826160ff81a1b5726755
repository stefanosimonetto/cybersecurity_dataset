Globo.com redirecting users to Spam ads

Globo.com, one of the largest Brazilian web portals (ranked #107 on Alexa and #6 for Brazilian traffic) appears to be compromised and all visits to it are being redirected to a sub page inside pagesinxt.com. If you go to g1.globo.com (or any other of their sub domains), you will end up on a page full of ads about Hosting, Internet and fake email products:

That redirection has been going for a few hours at least and we detected it for the first time around 8am EST and it is still live four hours later (noon EST).
What is going on?
We are investigating, but at the bottom of any page inside google.com there is a script being loaded from sawpf.com:

<script defer src="httx://sawpf.com/1.0.js"></script>

That javascript file is being very slow to load, but when it does, it runs the following code:

window.location = httx://pagesinxt.com/?dn=sawpf.com&fp=3WBUwymfgey…

Which forces the browser to redirect the to pagesinxt.com. At this point, we recommend all users to do not visit any globo.com page (or go there with Javascript disabled).
Who really owns your site?
This brings up a good topic that we brought up before. Who really owns your site? Every time you include a javascript (or widget or iframe), the security of your site becomes dependent on that third party server. It doesn’t looks like Globo in itself got compromised, but since they are including code from sawpf.com, they are only as secure as them.

Every time you add a remote JavaScript (or widget or iFrame) to your site, you are giving the server that houses that code full control of what is displayed to your users. If their servers get compromised, your site will be compromised as well.
Can you imagine if the author of the Easing Plugin was malicious? Instead of just that pop-up, they could have added a URL redirect to send all your users to any site they of their choosing (SPAM, porn, you name it). What if their server was hacked? The attackers could have added malware and it would have loaded to all your users.

*update 1: Lots of users on Twitter are complaining about it as well. Search for sawpf or pagesinxt to see the amount of people complaining or worried about it.
*update 2: If you click on some urls inside sawpf.com, you will be redirected to pagesinxt.com as well ( for example: httx://sawpf.com/libs/jquery/1.7.1.js )
