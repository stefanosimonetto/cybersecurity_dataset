Malvertising on The Pirate Bay drops ransomware
Popular torrent site The Pirate Bay was serving ransomware via a malvertising attack this week-end. The questionable advertiser was using a ‘pop-under’ to silently redirect users to the Magnitude exploit kit and infect them with the Cerber ransomware.
This is part of the same Magnitude EK malvertising campaigns we have documented previously on this blog. The ad network changes (Traffic Holder in this case), but the modus operandi remains the same.

RiskIQ also spotted the same advertiser pushing fake software. That domain has now been obliterated by CloudFlare.
