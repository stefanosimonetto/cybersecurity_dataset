Uploadify, Uploadify and Uploadify – The New TimThumb?

We are seeing a lot of noise again regarding the Uploadify script vulnerabilities affecting some WordPress themes/plugins. If you are not familiar, Uploadify allows anyone to upload anything they want to your site without any authentication.
Very very useful, no? Maybe, but at what cost? If a bad guy/gal knows that you have the Uploadify script, they can upload anything they want too (backdoors) and hack your site.
First, Uploadify is nothing new. When we were reporting on the TimThumb vulnerabilities, we were also notifying everyone about the issues with uploadify.
Been Around

In October of 2011 we warned everyone to remove and check for Uploadify: Remove Unused/Testing/Debug Software From Your Site
We put out a post in August of 2011 listing themes affected by TimThumb, we also listed the ones Using uploadify as unsafe: Timthumb Security Vulnerability – List of Themes
An oldie but goodie, TimThumb (Tip of the Iceberg), Uploadify was also included

This is definitely an issue, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg. TimThumb is just one of various scripts that are being added to themes/plugins without further vetting, or even incorrectly. Take Uploadify for example, which we’ve recently seen being exploited in very old versions of a popular WordPress theme.

What to do
Yes, we are seeing many Uploadify scans in the wild and sites getting compromised to it. If you have any of the themes/plugins we mentioned, we recommend deleting or disabling the uploadify script immediately. We also recommend doing a garage cleaning of your websites and servers, and delete any unused themes/plugins, since they can be compromised even if not in use.
