Sitting on the Lolbins, 11
August 31, 2019 in Anti-Forensics, Living off the land, LOLBins, Reusigned Binaries

A programmer who wrote a lolbin I presented previously is probably the same coder that wrote another program for Dell â€“ an application called Dell WebUpdater Executable.
Same as in the previous example, one needs to create a DLL with a name that is using a file name of a main lolbinish executable, and suffixed with wupd.dll, i.e. testwupd.dll for test.exe.
