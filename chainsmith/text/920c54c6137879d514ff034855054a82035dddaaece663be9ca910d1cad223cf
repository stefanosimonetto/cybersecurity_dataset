For testing purposes, we have made the package available now on a separate Up2Date server at 216.167.31.82. To use this server, please edit /root/.ssh/known_hosts and duplicate the line with the key, replacing the IP address.

Remarks

The Up2Date process takes 6 steps (1.826, 1.827, 1.888, 1.890, 2.000) and 1 dummy package (1.917) for jumping over 2.0 BETA (packetsizes: 1875315 2011116 1096186 10870973 3407213 110748 Bytes, sum: 18 MB)
After the last step your firewall will reboot
During step 5 the Up2Date LiveLog is possibly broken due to the installation of the new WebAdmin install (click on START again to reconnect to the Up2Date process)
