Avoid this Outlook Phish
Watch out for a phish mail in circulation which has a hankering for Outlook accounts.
The email reads as follows:

Clicking the link in the email – sbmarticles(dot)com/Z-zone/SigrypAmt2nd(dot)htm, which has already popped up on Phishtank – takes potential victims to a spot of data URI phishing.

Don’t be tricked into filling in login details via these types of attack – any email asking you to login or enter personal information (especially when warning you about account suspensions, unusual activity or any other form of shenanigans) should be treated with a generous helping of caution.
