Despite the prevalence of Web based client-side exploitation tools as the cybercrime ecosystem’s primary infection vector, in a series of blog posts, we’ve been emphasizing on the emergence of managed/hosted/DIY malicious Java applet generating tools/platforms, highlighting the existence of a growing market segment relying on ‘visual social engineering’ vectors for the purpose of tricking end users into executing malicious/rogue/fake Java applets, ultimately joining a cybercriminal’s botnet.
We’ve recently spotted yet another Web based Java drive-by generating tool, and decided to take a peek inside the malicious infrastructure supporting it.
More details:

Sample screenshot of the malicious Web-based Java drive-by generating tool:

Among the tool’s key differentiation features is the ability to generate undetected applets, make identical copies of legitimate Web sites for the purpose of socially engineering end users into thinking that they’re legitimate ones, as well as the option to host a potential cybercriminal’s campaign within the vendor’s own malicious bulletproof hosting infrastructure.
