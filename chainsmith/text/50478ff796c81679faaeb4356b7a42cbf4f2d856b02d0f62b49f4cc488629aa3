Alexa top sites – Blacklist for January/2011

Every month we analyze Alexa’s TOP 1 million site ranking and correlate that data with Google’s blacklist. Our goal is to get an overall view of the sites that are getting hacked, blacklisted, etc.
For Jan-2011, the number is pretty standard, but a little bit lower than previous months. Out of those top 1 million sites, around 1.4k had their main domain blacklisted (1,447 to be more exact). Compared to previous months, you can see a decline in there (2.1k in Dec, 2.5k in Nov, 3k and Oct, etc).
Why the decline? I would hope that it would be related to a safer Internet and people taking security more seriously, but based on the latest malware we have been analyzing, it seems that they are able to hide from Google pretty well (by not displaying the malware to Google’s IP addresses or to their user agents, etc).
These are the top 100 sites that were flagged and their respective ranking (You can get the full list here):

Note that the list above is composed of mostly legitimate sites that were hacked, not sites managed by the attackers themselves. The ones managed by the attackers and used to infect others were:

bfr7.co.cc
govtds18.co.cc
govtds17.co.cc
govtds15.co.cc
expa83.co.cc
suncool.co.cc
9bic.net
wwwbiogger.co.cc
wwwmoillihe.co.cc

And a lot more…  What is very interesting is the high percentage of .cc domains being used lately.  We will post more details in future posts. If you have any question or comment about it, let us know.
