Up2Date 7.502 Released

Up2Date V7.502 has been made available to solidify your Astaro installation. It is currently being distributed via our Up2Date system, and contains some new fixes and improvements. Continue reading for all the details. This release offers an updated version of the SSL VPN client, and we have also changed the HTTP proxy option for handling encrypted zip files to be consistent with other areas of WebAdmin. The checkbox option now says "Block unscannable content" (as it did in versions before 7.501), instead of "Pass unscannable content".

Network up2date

Up2Date V7.502 has been made available to solidify your Astaro installation. It is currently being distributed via our Up2Date system, and contains some new fixes and improvements. Continue reading for all the details.  This release offers an updated version of the SSL VPN client, and we have also changed the HTTP proxy option for handling encrypted zip files to be consistent with other areas of WebAdmin. The checkbox option now says "Block unscannable content" (as it did in versions before 7.501), instead of "Pass unscannable content".

Note: The feature remains the same, we’ve just changed the way the option is presented to the user. Your existing configuration behavior will not be changed; if you are already blocking these files they will stay blocked, if you are not blocking them, they will continue to pass.
