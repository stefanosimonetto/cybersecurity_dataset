When your TODO list is always short of something‚Ä¶
June 1, 2019 in Archaeology, Clustering, threat hunting

There is only one place visited by Windows coders less often than anything else: their program‚Äôs resource section. This is either a sacred or a scary place, depending on the coders‚Äô inner fears or strengths ‚Äì but no matter which one it is, with this post I want to draw your attention to program‚Äôs VERSIONINFO section.
If program is coded in Visual Studio ‚Äì its versioninfo is typically pre-populated with a bunch of boilerplate TODO strings:

It is the place where we specify the name of the program, its version, description, add copyright notice, and where we add the name of the company that produced it, etc.. Some programmers adjust these automatically via intricate command line tools or scripts, some edit these manually. Some‚Ä¶ forget to do so‚Ä¶.
Now‚Ä¶ creating software is exciting. Writing your new, revolutionary code is an exhilarating experience (or a dull one, if you are bored to death in your job), and with all these cool (boring) features you are adding so quickly, the poor versioninfo section is typically left behind.
Until the day you sign.
I mean, the day you literally sign your release .exe and then‚Ä¶ it becomes IMMORTAL.
Why immortal?
It‚Äôs signed‚Ä¶ kinda forever. Certificate revocations happen quite rarely. And if legitimate, your .exe will most likely end up on many popular download, mirroring sites, and/or in in AV and EDR repositories. And if it has a built-in vulnerability, backdoor, or some stupid logic flaw or dependency, and worse ‚Äì if there is an active exploit/trick for it ‚Äì you can be sure that it will become a long-living part of an arsenal of attacker groups. And if you still have doubts‚Ä¶ nothing is ever permanently deleted from the internet anyway üòâ
Back to your signed file‚Ä¶
If you have not edited these versioninfo properties ‚Äì they will make it to the signed build. If there is no proper QC process, the version information bits that you were supposed to fill-in early in the process will be left untouched e.g.:
TODO: File Description TODO: Company Name
Yup. Anyone viewing properties of your signed file will see something like this:

It‚Äôs ugly. And‚Ä¶  it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ common.
Over years I have seen many signed binaries with the version info populated with a default ‚ÄòTODO‚Äù boilerplate. I find it to be a truly interesting phenomenon. I mean, who would forget it before signing? Right?
I was curious how many companies actually did forget to change that boilerplate at some stage in the past. Obviously, I don‚Äôt have all the files of the world, so the list below is biased, but on the other hand, I have been collecting clean files for many years now‚Ä¶ so I think it‚Äôs still kinda representative ‚Äì especially that many big names are on it.
The examples are just single hash/company, but there are more hashes/company, obviously:

And I list these not to shame the companies. As I mentioned ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs an interesting phenomena from a sample clustering perspective, and I don‚Äôt think it really affects security in any significant way. At the end of the day, a signed file is still a signed file so you can be sure it‚Äôs ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than an unsigned one. Yes, there are malware families signed with a stolen or a forged certificate, but still, you will be always better off trusting the signed files more than non-signed ones.
Still‚Ä¶ how does it affect us, Blue teamers?
I don‚Äôt have all the answers and welcome comments. Obviously, adding exclusions/whitelists that treat ‚ÄòTODO‚Äô strings as a trusted ‚ÄòSigned Publisher‚Äô is not a good idea. This obviously adds a need for us to whitelist these files by hashes, or paths.
If found on the investigated system, these files may attract the attention of forensic investigators as well (e.g. if they look at autostart records and detect entries that point to signed TODO executables). After so many, heavily publicized reports about stolen certs, or supply chain attacks, it‚Äôs only natural to immediately generate hypothesis about ‚Äòif I see TODO: strings, this system was probably attacked by someone using malware signed with a stolen cert‚Äô.
Finally, it also exposes a less-discussed weakness of the signed files:
We often forget that there are programmers behind every signed fileThese coders make mistakes; many mistakes
‚Äì a.k.a. if there is a bug in versioninfo, there could be a bug in the code. Or‚Ä¶ it could be a feature :-).
Last, but not least: if you produce software on regular basis, please add the QC stage to your process where the release build is always checked against TODO entries. Kill the build if needed, because it is a proper build breaker. Fix it. Release good releases. Thank you.
