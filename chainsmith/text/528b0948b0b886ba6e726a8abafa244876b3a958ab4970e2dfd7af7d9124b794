Hi, I’m trying out movable type as blog software, and at the same I’m I’m using it to record security thoughts. I’m already posting some of this to a security forum at work, and also over at www.myitforum.com. At work its easy to post to a public folder via email. And it certainly looks to be easier to included images. On the other hand this can be accessed with an RSS feed.
