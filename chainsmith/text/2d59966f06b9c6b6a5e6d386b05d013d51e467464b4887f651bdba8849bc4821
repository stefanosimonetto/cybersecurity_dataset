Forensic Riddle #2 – Answer
November 28, 2011 in Forensic Riddles - Answers

This is the answer to Riddle #2.
This one was an easy one as long as you are familiar with short file names; running a command “dir /x” would reveal a short name “virus.exe” associated with an executable file hidden behind a long name suggesting a JPG picture.
Thanks for trying & next riddle on Friday!
