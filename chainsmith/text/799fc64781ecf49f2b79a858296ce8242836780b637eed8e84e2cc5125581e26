Up2Date 8.305 Released

Following last weeks release of 8.304, we have now released 8.305 which solves a small technical glitch in applying the fix fully on some installations. ISO's have already been updated, and to be sure the essential patches issud in 8.304 are completely applied for everyone, we'll err on the side of caution by publishing the fix for this as 8.305. We also address a possible cross-site scripting flaw with our backup page in WebAdmin that was reported by a 3rd party. The details can be found inside after the break.
