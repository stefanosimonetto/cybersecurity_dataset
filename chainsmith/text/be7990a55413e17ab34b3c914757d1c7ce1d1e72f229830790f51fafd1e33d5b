Four Adobe Flash 0-days In Three Weeks - Patches Now Available

<p>
Following on from the revelation of a 0-day in Adobe Flash in June 2015 (<a href="http://community.websense.com/blogs/securitylabs/archive/2015/06/24/adob..., since patched) 3 further 0-days have been discovered in the last 3 weeks.&nbsp; The 3 have references CVE-2015-5119, CVE-2015-5122, and CVE-2015-5123.</p>
<p>
The knowledge of the 0-day Proof of Concept code arose from analysis of the data breach from the Italian Hacking Team company.</p>
<h3>
The journey from discovery to exploit kit</h3>
<p>
Within hours of the exploit code being made public it was&nbsp;<a href="http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2015/07/cve-2015-5122-hackingteam-0d-t... have been incorporated into exploit kits including Angler, Neutrino, and NuclearPack.</p>
<p>
Telemetry from our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.websense.com/content/websense-threatseeker-network.aspx?cmpi... Intelligence Cloud</a>&nbsp;shows a spike in the the number of&nbsp; NuclearPack security incidents that we identified and protected against over the last few days:</p>

<h3>
Is your browser trying to tell you something?</h3>
<p>
Firefox has been configured to block the Flash plugin (aka Shockwave Flash) by default.&nbsp; You can see this through a warning presented underneath your address bar when you browse to a website that uses Flash, or there will be an overlay to the Flash artifact that would have been displayed:</p>

<p>
Further you can access the information via Menu &gt; Add-ons &gt; Plugins.&nbsp; The example below tells us that the version of Flash Player in our environment is known to be vulnerable:</p>

<h3>
How to update your Flash Player?</h3>
<p>
You can check which version of Flash Player you have running here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/">http://www.adobe.com/softwar...
<p>
For example, the Adobe website is able to tell us that we are running an older version of Adobe Flash Player in our virtual environment:</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/blog/legacy/5584.version_18_0_0_203.png-550x0.png" style="height:107px; width:174px" /></p>
<p>
The latest version of Flash (as of 14 July 2015 2:30pm BST) is 18.0.0.209, 11.2.202.481, or 11.2.202.223 depending on your OS and browser combination.</p>
<p>
You can download the latest version of Flash here:&nbsp;<a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</...
<p>
An alternative mitigation strategy would be to consider if disabling Flash Player is appropriate in your environment.</p>
<p>
You can monitor the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) Blog at&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/">https://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/</a>&nbsp;for details of any upcoming patches should any further vulnerabilities beidentified.</p>

Protection Offered to Raytheon|Websense Customers</h3>
<h4>
CVE-2015-5119 &ndash; A Case Study</h4>
<p>
These vulnerabilities, if and when incorporated into existing exploit kits, will still be blocked by Raytheon|Websense solutions because we have a variety of detection techniques across the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.websense.com/sevenstages?cmpid=slbl">7 Stages of Advanced Threats</a>&nbsp;via real-time analytics within ACE, our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.websense.com/content/websense-advanced-classification-engine... Classification Engine</a>.&nbsp; This includes:</p>
<p>
Stage 3 (Redirect) - the detection of known malicious sites</p>
<p>
Stage 6 (Call Home) - detection of command and control channels</p>
<p>
Stage 7 (Data Theft) &ndash; to reduce the occurrence of data exfiltration</p>
<p>
If exploitation of these vulnerabilities is incorporated into wholly new exploit kits then we are capable of detecting malicious behaviour through our heuristics, behavioural monitoring, and analysis techniques.</p>
<p>
We will update coverage as necessary to keep our customers protected.</p>
