Twitter Spamrun: “Isn’t This You?”
Watch out for this spam run taking place on Twitter:

The spam spreading on compromised accounts are bundles of @ messages sent to Twitter uses, which say the following:
“isnt this you? po(dot)st/[url removed]”
The links we’ve checked so far – and there are a lot of them, as the 300+ messages posted in just over 15 minutes on the above screenshot show – lead to a page asking Twitter users to “verify your account”.

If you think your account has been compromised by any form of spam run, feel free to follow our Twitter lockdown tips and if you’re sent a rogue @ message by a friend you may want to help them sort their profiles out too.
