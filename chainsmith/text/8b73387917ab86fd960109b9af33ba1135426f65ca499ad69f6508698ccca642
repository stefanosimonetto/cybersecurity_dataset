The subject lines of our blog posts may, or may not be appealing to you, but we hope you’ll enjoy the body of our posts, and if you do, there is now a “Like” button down at the bottom of the page for each blog post.

For those of you using NoScript, you’ll need to allow (or temporarily allow) facebook.net or you won’t see the button.

Why a “Like” button, but no “Dislike” button? Well, “Liking” a post is like tipping the messenger, but disliking a post is like shooting the messenger, and that just isn’t cool :)

If you really want to express your disapproval, you can always leave a comment. If you use NoScript and don’t want to allow Facebook.net, we’re security folks, we understand… You can also do things the old fashioned way and leave a comment too!
