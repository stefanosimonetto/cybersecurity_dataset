Email Malware

I’m seeing some interesting things in email this weekend. The first is some email detected as “Exploit/Mime-boundary-quote”. MIME boundary issues may be exploited so that a SMTP gateway email scanner will not detect a virus, but Outlook will be able to interpret the MIME as an attachment. Well, its not getting by our scanner.
The second thing I’m seeing is more Stration virus variants being spammed out. As you’ll recall, Stration is most often characterized as having an attachment named postcard.exe. I’m also seeing an attachment message.dat.cmd. At the time we received the new Stration it was detected heuristically. The signatures weren’t yet available.
