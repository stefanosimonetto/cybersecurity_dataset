      "326.12 --> take a look at these kind of services\n",
      "328.479 --> and also there are one uh HTTP Port open\n",

      "366.8 --> very honest at the beginning we don't\n",

      "375.56 --> of these parameter is a name you can\n",
      "377.319 --> provide us etc etc so this is how it\n",
      "380.68 --> work normally you provide few parameter\n",
      "383.44 --> and you you have the result the output\n",
      "385.88 --> like as this configuration is created\n",
      "388.72 --> all right so we continue and of course\n",
      "390.56 --> we try to inject magicious think in this\n",
      "393.84 --> parameter you try to break something but\n",
      "397.039 --> nothing works all right how we achieve\n",
      "401.319 --> to find something interesting U um we\n",
      "404.199 --> decide to sniff the port 1128 using tcpm\n",
      "408.24 --> for example and what we realize it's\n",

      "485.56 --> patched uh so this is the what I show\n",
      "488.199 --> what we show the first uh the first one\n",
      "490.52 --> the second one we explain everything in\n",
      "492.039 --> the in the white paper it's more\n",
      "493.599 --> complicated but uh this is not for today\n",
      "497.68 --> so now we understand how we can execute\n",
      "500.36 --> Roots but uh we have some condition and\n",
      "503.479 --> of course we need to have at least user\n",

      "515.2 --> and this is for pao so let's move on\n",
      "518.279 --> with the following research and this is\n",

      "557.72 --> solution manager or the enterprise\n",
      "559.44 --> portal and build on top of this layer\n",
      "561.6 --> which means that all of those Solutions\n",
      "563.399 --> are going to implement\n",
      "565.04 --> before when we started this research we\n",
      "567.2 --> didn't know anything about before we\n",
      "568.519 --> jump into the documentation and we see\n",
      "570.16 --> this snippet of code that ACP say okay\n",
      "572.36 --> if you want to connect to4 you have to\n",
      "574.0 --> use something like this if you pay a\n",
      "575.959 --> little bit of attention is doing a GDI\n",

      "603.32 --> one basically what you can do is by\n",

      "1167.919 --> simple tool that connects to your SCP\n",
      "1170.24 --> system of course giving credentials is\n",
      "1172.039 --> not an offensive uh tool which will um\n",
      "1175.88 --> download some specific files and we'll\n",
      "1177.96 --> analyze them and based on that we'll\n",
      "1179.72 --> create the list of HTTP entry points\n",
      "1182.0 --> that the system has it's a way to also\n",
      "1184.44 --> measure the exposure of your ACP\n",
      "1187.12 --> system uh yeah we're going to make pish\n",
      "1189.52 --> this uh maybe later today or or\n",
      "1192.039 --> tomorrow uh by using J we launch it\n",
      "1194.559 --> against one of the solutions maybe the\n",
      "1196.6 --> most famous ones of FP that is called\n",
      "1198.6 --> the enterprise portal the particularity\n",
      "1200.6 --> of this solution is that it's widely\n",
      "1203.6 --> exposed to the internet and we found uh\n",

      "1208.039 --> exposed without authentication so we\n",
      "1210.2 --> jump into the\n",
      "1211.72 --> analysis as many seets it starts all\n",
      "1214.28 --> from a dog get or yeah a Handler for get\n",
      "1216.84 --> requests and as you can see there in the\n",
      "1219.679 --> in the screen uh highlighted at least\n",
      "1222.32 --> three different parameters are extracted\n",
      "1224.4 --> from the request of the\n",

      "1230.24 --> have to believe me that there is a path\n",
      "1231.96 --> that from the two get you can achieve a\n",

      "1263.679 --> of that specific\n",
      "1265.2 --> object so with further analysis we\n",
      "1268.28 --> understand that there was these object\n",
      "1269.919 --> were called connectors uh and there were\n",
      "1272.64 --> some of them like eight or nine\n",
      "1274.6 --> available in the SCP system so we just\n",
      "1276.279 --> gra the first one the PCD one and we\n",
      "1279.76 --> went to the r function of that object\n",
      "1282.84 --> what we found was that uh if you get if\n",

      "1328.4 --> and understand what was going on\n",
      "1331.039 --> there we came across this amazing talk\n",

      "1934.12 --> patch uh there are not a lot of work on\n",

      "1965.679 --> like to provide uh for what we take away\n",
      "1970.84 --> uh the first one is about\n",
      "1973.279 --> CVSs if youve notice on the table\n",
      "1976.44 --> previously the the CVSs score come from\n",
      "1979.2 --> five uh score five to uh to 10 and also\n",
      "1984.039 --> uh to be able to uh start any kind of\n",
      "1987.0 --> application remotely the CVSs is\n",
      "1990.12 --> 6.5 it's not high it's medium but you\n",
      "1994.399 --> understand it's open the gate to people\n",
      "1997.32 --> and then you can reach other\n",
      "1999.399 --> vulnerability so again CVSs is important\n",
      "2003.0 --> but also it's very important to have a\n",
      "2005.159 --> global view of what possibility what we\n",
      "2007.48 --> can do by Chain several s vity and it's\n",
      "2013.24 --> not\n",
      "2014.279 --> easy uh another conclusion is that uh\n",
      "2017.039 --> based on our experience uh you don't\n",
      "2018.84 --> need to be an expert to jump into a\n",
      "2021.039 --> doing research is a specific field uh\n",
      "2023.44 --> again when we started this one this we\n",
      "2025.44 --> didn't know too much about Java and yet\n",
      "2028.24 --> we were able to have some good results\n",
      "2030.72 --> so yes our recommendation is if you are\n",
      "2033.2 --> struggling to say hey should I start\n",
      "2035.32 --> this research should I go through it you\n",
      "2038.24 --> will learn in a journey and it will be\n",
      "2040.519 --> hopefully funny at least yeah and also\n",
      "2043.24 --> don't be afraid to jump in new area uh\n",
      "2046.039 --> for example for her people was like\n",
      "2049.159 --> blackb services without a lot of\n",
      "2051.8 --> information but we try we make a short\n",
      "2055.28 --> like hey let's try and at the beginning\n",
      "2057.56 --> it was hard to understand how is how is\n",
      "2059.52 --> it going but the the when you are inside\n",
      "2062.96 --> and you start understand how is it going\n",
      "2066.399 --> this is where the magic happen and you\n",
      "2068.079 --> can understand hey I can do that I\n",

      "2072.919 --> offensive security researcher don't be\n",
      "2075.639 --> afraid to to to try new things and\n",
      "2080.159 --> finally uh something that is also based\n",
      "2082.359 --> on our experience and just nothing new\n",
      "2084.44 --> is do not try to pursue the Silver\n",
      "2086.2 --> Bullet that vulnerability that is uh a\n",
      "2088.52 --> unique vulnerability that will allow you\n",
      "2090.599 --> without authentication to get roote\n",
      "2092.399 --> access with everything because sometimes\n",
      "2094.96 --> uh from a let's say psychological point\n",
      "2096.76 --> of you could be frustrating for the\n",
      "2098.04 --> researcher um from my point of view it's\n",
      "2100.04 --> easy to go for lead vulnerabilities and\n",
      "2102.76 --> try to have some winnings in the middle\n",
      "2105.76 --> and try to then afterwards combine them\n",
      "2107.839 --> into a at the end of the day hopefully\n",
      "2110.359 --> have the same impact as uh one only\n",
      "2114.359 --> vity and also we like to thank you a lot\n",
