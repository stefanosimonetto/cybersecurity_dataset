.ORG whois reporting DNSSEC status

I was glad to see a handful of whois updates today coming from all the .ORGs that we are monitoring at Sucuri.
Basically now at the end of the Whois, it is showing if that domain is using DNSSEC or not. Example for mozilla.org:
$ whois mozilla.orgName Server:NS1.MOZILLA.ORGName Server:NS2.MOZILLA.ORGName Server:NS3.MOZILLA.ORG DNSSEC:Unsigned
Because of that I got hundreds of notifications about those changes:
Sucuri nbim: www.kernel.org whois modifiedModifications:86a87> DNSSEC:Unsigned
Sucuri nbim: ubuntulinux.org whois modifiedModifications:88a89> DNSSEC:Unsigned
Sucuri nbim: fsf.org whois modifiedModifications:86a87> DNSSEC:Unsigned
And many moreâ€¦ Want to stay updated to what is happening with the whois information of your domains? What about DNS changes, site changes, blacklisting status, etc? Try our Internet presence security monitoring for free to get started.
