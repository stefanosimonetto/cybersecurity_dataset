The 2024 edition of the CrowdStrike Global Threat Report arrives at
[Word Count: 11]

a pivotal moment for our global community of protectors. The speed
[Word Count: 11]

and ferocity of cyberattacks continue to accelerate as adversaries
[Word Count: 9]

compress the time between initial entry, lateral movement and breach.
[Word Count: 10]

At the same time, the rise of generative AI has the potential to lower the
[Word Count: 15]

barrier of entry for low-skilled adversaries, making it easier to launch
[Word Count: 11]

attacks that are more sophisticated and state of the art.
[Word Count: 10]

These trends are driving a tectonic shift in the security landscape and
[Word Count: 12]

the world. The “good enough” approach to cybersecurity is simply no
[Word Count: 11]

longer good enough for modern threats. As organizations increasingly
[Word Count: 9]

move business to the cloud, adversaries are advancing their capabilities
[Word Count: 10]

to exploit this, and abuse features unique to the cloud. We continue to
[Word Count: 13]

see identity-based attacks take center stage, as adversaries focus on
[Word Count: 10]

social engineering attacks that bypass multifactor authentication.
[Word Count: 7]

The use of legitimate tools to execute an attack, an increasingly
[Word Count: 11]

prevalent technique, impedes the ability to differentiate between
[Word Count: 8]

We are entering an era of a cyber arms race where AI will amplify
[Word Count: 14]

the impact for both the security professional and the adversary.
[Word Count: 10]

Organizations cannot afford to fall behind, and the legacy technology
[Word Count: 10]

of yesterday is no match for the speed and sophistication of the
[Word Count: 12]

With the release of the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report, our
[Word Count: 11]

elite Counter Adversary Operations team is delivering the actionable
[Word Count: 9]

intelligence you need to stay ahead of today’s threats and secure your
[Word Count: 12]

future. This year’s report provides critical insight and observations into
[Word Count: 10]

►
The tactics and techniques that adversaries use to exploit
[Word Count: 10]

►
The continued exploitation of stolen identity credentials
[Word Count: 8]

and increasingly sophisticated methods adversaries use to gain
[Word Count: 8]

►
The growing menace of supply chain attacks and exploitation
[Word Count: 10]

of trusted software to maximize the ROI of attacks
[Word Count: 9]

►
The potential for adversaries to target global elections in a year
[Word Count: 12]

that has the potential to transform geopolitics around the world
[Word Count: 10]

From Day One, CrowdStrike has said, “You don’t have a malware
[Word Count: 11]

problem, you have an adversary problem.” We pioneered the concept
[Word Count: 10]

of adversary-focused cybersecurity because it’s the best way to
[Word Count: 9]

protect customers and stop breaches. We know the adversary better
[Word Count: 10]

than anyone, and we use this insight to guide our innovation, protect
[Word Count: 12]

customers, stop breaches and increase the cost to the adversary.
[Word Count: 10]

A secure future requires a strong foundation. This is what we’re
[Word Count: 11]

delivering with the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon® XDR platform.
[Word Count: 8]

We’re driving the convergence of data, cybersecurity and IT, with
[Word Count: 10]

generative AI and workflow automation built natively within a single,
[Word Count: 10]

unified platform to give you and your teams the speed you need to
[Word Count: 13]

I hope you find the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report informative
[Word Count: 11]

and inspiring in our shared fight against the adversary. CrowdStrike will
[Word Count: 11]

remain unrelenting in our mission to deliver the security outcome you

[Word Count: 6]

As we reflect on the 2023 cyber threat landscape, the theme of stealth prevails.
[Word Count: 14]

Adversaries have faced a hardening attack surface thanks to advancements in threat
[Word Count: 12]

defense technology and threat awareness, and they have responded by increasingly
[Word Count: 11]

adopting and relying on techniques that empower them to move faster and evade
[Word Count: 13]

These techniques are evident in the consistent prevalence of eCrime, a highly attractive
[Word Count: 13]

and lucrative business venture for many criminals. Unsurprisingly, eCrime persisted as
[Word Count: 11]

the most pervasive threat across the 2023 threat landscape as adversaries leveraged
[Word Count: 12]

techniques to maximize stealth, speed and impact.
[Word Count: 7]

While ransomware remains the tool of choice for many big game hunting
[Word Count: 12]

(BGH) adversaries, data-theft extortion continues to be an attractive — and often
[Word Count: 12]

easier — monetization route, as evidenced by the 76% increase in the number of
[Word Count: 14]

victims named on BGH dedicated leak sites (DLSs) between 2022 and 2023.
[Word Count: 12]

Access brokers continued to profit by providing initial access to eCrime threat
[Word Count: 12]

actors throughout the year, with the number of advertised accesses increasing
[Word Count: 11]

Nation-state adversaries were also active throughout 2023. China-nexus adversaries
[Word Count: 9]

continued to operate at an unmatched pace across the global landscape, leveraging
[Word Count: 12]

stealth and scale to collect targeted group surveillance data, strategic intelligence and
[Word Count: 12]

In other areas of the world, conflict continued to drive nation-state and hacktivist
[Word Count: 13]

adversary activity. In 2023, as the Russia-Ukraine war entered its second year,
[Word Count: 12]

Russia-nexus adversaries and activity clusters maintained high, sustained levels of
[Word Count: 10]

activity in support of Russian Intelligence Service intelligence collection, disruptive
[Word Count: 10]

activity, and information operations (IO) targeting Ukraine and NATO countries.
[Word Count: 10]

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT

[Word Count: 6]

Iran-nexus adversaries and Middle East hacktivist adversaries were also observed
[Word Count: 10]

pivoting cyber operations in the latter half of the year in alignment with kinetic
[Word Count: 14]

operations stemming from the 2023 Israel-Hamas conflict.
[Word Count: 7]

North Korean adversaries maintained a consistently high tempo throughout 2023.
[Word Count: 10]

Their activity continued to focus on financial gain via cryptocurrency theft and
[Word Count: 12]

intelligence collection from South Korean and Western organizations, specifically
[Word Count: 9]

in the academic, aerospace, defense, government, manufacturing, media and
[Word Count: 9]

Across the rest of the world, stealth played a key role in adversary activity
[Word Count: 14]

focused on digital surveillance, information collection and control in support of
[Word Count: 11]

government agendas. The assessed geographic range of this activity, as well as
[Word Count: 12]

the capabilities and target scope of global threat actors, continued to underscore
[Word Count: 12]

the extent to which targeted intrusion capabilities have proliferated beyond those
[Word Count: 11]

demonstrated by commonly reported countries. In some cases, this activity
[Word Count: 10]

was assisted by private sector offensive actors and openly available adversary
[Word Count: 11]

One of the greatest threat actor motivations driving stealth in cyber threat
[Word Count: 12]

operations is CrowdStrike’s development of new products and partnerships
[Word Count: 9]

throughout 2023. These changed the stakes within the operational landscape and
[Word Count: 11]

In 2023, CrowdStrike Falcon® Intelligence and CrowdStrike® Falcon OverWatch™
[Word Count: 9]

merged to become CrowdStrike Counter Adversary Operations (CAO). Combining
[Word Count: 9]

the power of threat intelligence with the speed of dedicated hunting teams and
[Word Count: 13]

trillions of cutting-edge telemetry events from the AI-native CrowdStrike Falcon®
[Word Count: 10]

platform that detect, disrupt and stop today’s sophisticated adversaries, this
[Word Count: 10]

merger has exponentially raised the business cost of conducting cyberattacks.
[Word Count: 10]

In 2024, CrowdStrike CAO repackaged CrowdStrike’s threat intelligence modules
[Word Count: 9]

to add managed threat hunting (an industry first), empowering organizations to
[Word Count: 11]

better pursue adversaries and stop breaches.
[Word Count: 6]

Over the course of 2023, CrowdStrike CAO introduced 34 new adversaries —
[Word Count: 12]

including a newly tracked, Egypt-based adversary, WATCHFUL SPHINX — raising
[Word Count: 10]

the total number of actors tracked across all motivations to 232. In addition to
[Word Count: 14]

named adversaries, CrowdStrike CAO tracks more than 130 active malicious
[Word Count: 10]

CrowdStrike CAO drives unparalleled, actionable reporting coverage that
[Word Count: 8]

captures new cyber threat developments in real time and identifies and tracks
[Word Count: 12]

new adversaries. The CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report sheds light on the
[Word Count: 12]

standout trends from last year, how adversaries’ activities and motivations are
[Word Count: 11]

evolving and the ways CrowdStrike anticipates the threat landscape will evolve

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

Today’s cyber threats are particularly alarming due to the widespread use of hands-on or “interactive
[Word Count: 15]

intrusion” techniques, which involve adversaries actively executing actions on a host to accomplish their
[Word Count: 14]

objectives. Unlike malware attacks that depend on the deployment of malicious tooling and scripts,
[Word Count: 14]

interactive intrusions leverage the creativity and problem-solving skills of human adversaries. These
[Word Count: 12]

individuals can mimic expected user and administrator behavior, making it difficult for defenders to
[Word Count: 14]

differentiate between legitimate user activity and a cyberattack.
[Word Count: 8]

In 2023, CrowdStrike observed a 60% year-over-year increase in the number of interactive intrusion
[Word Count: 14]

campaigns, with a 73% increase in the second half compared to 2022.
[Word Count: 12]

The technology sector was the most frequently targeted industry in which CrowdStrike CAO observed
[Word Count: 14]

interactive intrusion activity in 2023, a continuing trend from 2022. The charts below reflect the relative
[Word Count: 16]

frequency of intrusions in the top 10 industry verticals and in geographical regions.
[Word Count: 13]

After gaining initial access to a network, adversaries seek to “break out” and move laterally from the
[Word Count: 17]

compromised host to other hosts within the environment. The time it takes for them to do this —
[Word Count: 18]

“breakout time” — is crucial because the initially compromised machines are rarely the ones adversaries
[Word Count: 15]

need to achieve their goals. They must move laterally into the network, conduct reconnaissance, establish
[Word Count: 15]

persistence and locate their targets. Responding within the breakout time window allows defenders to
[Word Count: 14]

mitigate costs and other damages associated with intrusions.
[Word Count: 8]

This year, the average breakout time for interactive eCrime intrusion activity decreased from 84 minutes in
[Word Count: 16]

2022 to 62 minutes in 2023. The fastest observed breakout time was only 2 minutes and 7 seconds.

Anatomy of an eCrime 
Interactive Intrusion
[Word Count: 6]

In this case, the security team had the “quarantine on write” policy setting
[Word Count: 13]

disabled, enabling the four files to be written to disk. The adversary
[Word Count: 12]

executed a legitimate tool to obtain system information for reconnaissance
[Word Count: 10]

and then dropped three more files, including ransomware, onto the system.
[Word Count: 11]

They attempted to execute a network discovery and reconnaissance tool
[Word Count: 10]

to map out lateral movement options, which was immediately blocked and
[Word Count: 11]

quarantined by the Falcon sensor. This caused the adversary to open the
[Word Count: 12]

control panel to understand which security tool was in use. When they
[Word Count: 12]

identified the Falcon platform, they never attempted to execute the second
[Word Count: 11]

discovery tool or the ransomware (which would have been prevented and
[Word Count: 11]

quarantined) and moved to another victim. Within minutes, CrowdStrike CAO
[Word Count: 10]

threat hunters notified the customer, took the machine offline and reset the
[Word Count: 12]

Once an initial compromise occurs, it only takes seconds for adversaries to
[Word Count: 12]

drop tools and/or malware on a victim’s environment during an interactive
[Word Count: 11]

intrusion. However, the saying “time is money” holds true for adversaries.
[Word Count: 11]

More than 88% of the attack time was dedicated to breaking in and gaining
[Word Count: 14]

initial access. By reducing or eliminating this time, adversaries free up
[Word Count: 11]

To do this, they have continued to move beyond malware to faster, more
[Word Count: 13]

effective means such as identity attacks (phishing, social engineering
[Word Count: 9]

and access brokers) and the exploitation of vulnerabilities and trusted
[Word Count: 10]

relationships. This trend is apparent over the last five years, as malware-free
[Word Count: 12]

activity represented 75% of detections in 2023 — up from 71% in 2022.
[Word Count: 13]

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

This trend is partly related to the success of identity attacks, access
[Word Count: 12]

brokers and the prolific abuse of valid credentials to facilitate access and
[Word Count: 12]

persistence in victim environments. Access brokers are threat actors who
[Word Count: 10]

acquire access to organizations and provide or sell this access to other
[Word Count: 12]

actors, including ransomware operators. These adversaries continued to
[Word Count: 8]

profit from providing initial access to a variety of eCrime threat actors in
[Word Count: 13]

2023, with the number of accesses advertised increasing by almost 20%
[Word Count: 11]

Today’s sophisticated cyberattacks only take minutes to succeed.
[Word Count: 8]

Adversaries use techniques such as interactive hands-on-keyboard
[Word Count: 7]

attacks and legitimate tools to attempt to hide from detection. To further
[Word Count: 12]

accelerate attack tempo, adversaries can access credentials in multiple
[Word Count: 9]

ways, including purchasing them from access brokers for a few hundred
[Word Count: 11]

dollars. Organizations must prioritize protecting identities in 2024.
[Word Count: 8]

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

Adversaries spanning multiple motivations and regions continue to use
[Word Count: 9]

phishing techniques spoofing legitimate users to target valid accounts,
[Word Count: 9]

as well as other authentication and identifying data, to conduct their attacks.
[Word Count: 12]

In addition to stealing account credentials, CrowdStrike CAO observed
[Word Count: 9]

adversaries targeting API keys and secrets, session cookies and tokens,
[Word Count: 10]

one-time passwords (OTPs) and Kerberos tickets throughout 2023.
[Word Count: 8]

14
CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

Adversaries can authenticate to a system and/or user account using
[Word Count: 10]

stolen credentials, which can either be obtained by the adversary
[Word Count: 10]

directly (for example, using information stealers or exploiting
[Word Count: 8]

unmanaged edge devices) or by purchasing them.
[Word Count: 7]

Access to protected resources using stolen API keys and secrets may
[Word Count: 11]

allow an adversary to steal sensitive data. Unless the API keys and
[Word Count: 12]

secrets are changed, the adversary could maintain indefinite access.
[Word Count: 9]

Adversaries can steal session cookies and tokens to masquerade as the
[Word Count: 11]

legitimate user and authenticate to an application.
[Word Count: 7]

OTP theft allows the adversary to bypass multifactor authentication
[Word Count: 9]

(MFA) by SIM swapping, SS7 attacks, socially engineering the victim or
[Word Count: 11]

By stealing or forging Kerberos tickets, adversaries can gain access to
[Word Count: 11]

encrypted credentials, which can then be cracked offline. CrowdStrike
[Word Count: 9]

CAO recorded a 583% increase in Kerberoasting attacks in 2023.

BEAR Adversaries 
Conduct Credential 
Collection Campaigns
[Word Count: 6]

FANCY BEAR conducted regular credential collection campaigns throughout 2023.
[Word Count: 9]

In March 2023, Microsoft patched a zero-day elevation-of-privilege vulnerability
[Word Count: 9]

in Microsoft Outlook (CVE-2023-23397), which FANCY BEAR had been exploiting
[Word Count: 10]

since at least March 2022 to solicit NT LAN Manager authentication sessions from
[Word Count: 13]

targets using specially crafted spear-phishing emails. The Polish Cyber Command
[Word Count: 10]

reported that the adversary used this authentication data to connect to Exchange
[Word Count: 12]

servers and change additional high-value account mailbox permissions through
[Word Count: 9]

FANCY BEAR also conducted credential phishing campaigns and developed a
[Word Count: 10]

custom toolkit to capture credentials from Yahoo! Mail and ukr.net webmail users.
[Word Count: 12]

The adversary expanded this toolkit to use the Browser-in-the-Browser technique
[Word Count: 10]

in April 2023 and added MFA interception capabilities to its toolkit to collect OTPs
[Word Count: 14]

sent to the MFA contact (e.g., a phone number) linked to the targeted account.
[Word Count: 14]

COZY BEAR has conducted credential phishing campaigns using Microsoft Teams
[Word Count: 10]

messages to solicit MFA tokens for Microsoft 365 accounts since at least late May
[Word Count: 14]

2023. If a user accepts its initial message request, COZY BEAR attempts to socially
[Word Count: 14]

engineer the target by claiming a change was made to their current MFA settings
[Word Count: 14]

and stating an MFA code is required for verification.
[Word Count: 9]

CrowdStrike® Services has observed COZY BEAR connecting to a compromised
[Word Count: 10]

account using Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure Active Directory) before
[Word Count: 10]

registering a new device and enabling a passwordless phone sign-in for the user.
[Word Count: 13]

The adversary also exported certificates containing private keys and requested a

SCATTERED SPIDER 
Conducts Sophisticated 
Social Engineering Campaigns
[Word Count: 7]

Identity-based techniques are also central to SCATTERED SPIDER tradecraft.
[Word Count: 9]

Throughout 2023, this adversary conducted sophisticated social engineering
[Word Count: 8]

campaigns to access victim accounts. SCATTERED SPIDER’s tactics included
[Word Count: 9]

SMS phishing (smishing) and voice phishing (vishing) to harvest credentials and
[Word Count: 11]

phone calls made to victim organization help desks to persuade support personnel
[Word Count: 12]

to provide password and/or MFA resets for targeted accounts. In many cases,
[Word Count: 12]

SCATTERED SPIDER also leveraged earlier intrusions at telecom organizations
[Word Count: 9]

to SIM swap targeted employee phone numbers, enabling the adversary to then
[Word Count: 12]

receive SMS messages containing OTP codes.
[Word Count: 6]

SCATTERED SPIDER deliberately selects social engineering campaign targets
[Word Count: 8]

from employees in information security and other IT-related teams. This is
[Word Count: 11]

likely due to direct employee access to security tools as well as applications
[Word Count: 13]

and documentation that may support lateral movement and further account
[Word Count: 10]

compromise. In a minority of incidents, SCATTERED SPIDER targeted accounts
[Word Count: 10]

belonging to employees who had direct access to company financial resources.
[Word Count: 11]

Additionally, SCATTERED SPIDER often configured residential proxies to appear as
[Word Count: 10]

though they were logging in to victim accounts from the same geographical area
[Word Count: 13]

as the legitimate account owner. In doing so, the adversary further exhibited its
[Word Count: 13]

understanding of identity-related security policies in enterprise organizations.
[Word Count: 8]

As predicted, cloud environment intrusions increased by 75% from 2022 to 2023 (Figure
[Word Count: 13]

2), with cloud-conscious cases increasing by 110% and cloud-agnostic cases increasing
[Word Count: 11]

Cloud-conscious is a term referring to threat actors who are aware of the ability to
[Word Count: 15]

compromise cloud workloads and use this knowledge to abuse features unique to the
[Word Count: 13]

eCrime adversaries are especially active in targeting cloud environments:
[Word Count: 9]

84% of cloud-conscious intrusions attributed to adversaries were conducted
[Word Count: 9]

by likely eCrime actors, compared to 16% conducted by targeted intrusion
[Word Count: 11]

actors. Traditional BGH adversaries, such as INDRIK SPIDER, became more
[Word Count: 10]

SCATTERED SPIDER predominantly drove cloud-conscious activity increases
[Word Count: 7]

throughout 2023, accounting for 29% of total cases. Throughout 2023,
[Word Count: 10]

SCATTERED SPIDER demonstrated progressive and sophisticated tradecraft
[Word Count: 7]

within targeted cloud environments to maintain persistence, obtain credentials,
[Word Count: 9]

Adversaries’ preference for identity-based techniques is evident in their

Adversaries relied on valid credentials to achieve initial access.
[Word Count: 9]

They obtained these credentials via accidental credential leakage, brute-force
[Word Count: 9]

attacks, phishing/social engineering, credential stealers, access brokers, insecure
[Word Count: 8]

self-service password-reset services and insider threats.
[Word Count: 6]

To maintain access to Azure and Microsoft 365, adversaries commonly achieved

Threat Highlight: 
Trusted-Relationship Compromises by 
China-Nexus Adversaries
[Word Count: 7]

In 2023, China-nexus adversaries increasingly targeted third-party relationships
[Word Count: 8]

in efforts to deploy malicious implants and gain initial access. Two adversaries —
[Word Count: 13]

JACKPOT PANDA and CASCADE PANDA — consistently exploited trusted
[Word Count: 9]

relationships through supply chain compromises and actor-on-the-side
[Word Count: 7]

or actor-in-the-middle attacks. In each case, the operations focused on
[Word Count: 10]

Chinese-speaking victims, possibly indicating ongoing domestic surveillance.
[Word Count: 7]

Throughout 2023, JACKPOT PANDA continued to use trojanized executables to deploy
[Word Count: 11]

malicious utilities or second-stage implants. Beginning in May 2023, the adversary
[Word Count: 11]

used a trojanized installer for CloudChat, a China-based chat application popular with
[Word Count: 12]

illegal, Chinese-speaking gambling communities in Mainland China. The trojanized
[Word Count: 9]

installer served from CloudChat’s website contained the first stage of a multi-step
[Word Count: 12]

process that ultimately deployed XShade — a novel implant with code that overlaps
[Word Count: 13]

with JACKPOT PANDA’s unique CplRAT implant.
[Word Count: 6]

Additional JACKPOT PANDA activity was identified in May 2023 using a signed
[Word Count: 12]

.NET downloader, dubbed QuestDownloader, launched by a LiveHelp100 process.
[Word Count: 9]

LiveHelp100 is associated with Comm100, a software utility targeted by a JACKPOT
[Word Count: 12]

PANDA supply chain compromise in September 2022. QuestDownloader was ultimately
[Word Count: 10]

used to deploy Cobalt Strike and UltraVNC.
[Word Count: 7]

Beginning in late 2023, CASCADE PANDA routinely used likely actor-in-the-middle or
[Word Count: 11]

actor-on-the-side attacks to intercept legitimate update traffic from common utilities,
[Word Count: 10]

as well as Chinese-language tools, to deploy WinDealer — a malicious remote access
[Word Count: 13]

tool (RAT) uniquely associated with this adversary. In all CASCADE PANDA instances
[Word Count: 12]

from this time period, legitimate software update processes connected to legitimate
[Word Count: 11]

infrastructure associated with respective products and legitimate Chinese internet
[Word Count: 9]

CASCADE PANDA likely distributes WinDealer by using domestic infrastructure
[Word Count: 9]

to redirect legitimate traffic in transit. In one instance, CASCADE PANDA used a
[Word Count: 13]

legitimate trojanized Chinese-language translation tool executable to deploy WinDealer.
[Word Count: 9]

Unattributed targeted intrusion actors using TTPs consistent with China-nexus
[Word Count: 9]

adversaries also exploited trusted relationships to conduct operations in 2023.
[Word Count: 10]

Throughout the second half of the year, an unattributed actor compromised an
[Word Count: 12]

India-based information security software vendor and used the resulting access to
[Word Count: 11]

distribute trojanized executables via legitimate software update processes.
[Word Count: 8]

These attacks target victims from multiple regions and industries, including the
[Word Count: 11]

construction, financial services, government, technology, telecom and logistics
[Word Count: 8]

sectors throughout the U.S., India, Brazil, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Zambia,
[Word Count: 11]

Mexico and Malaysia. Though this trusted-relationship exploitation activity remains
[Word Count: 9]

unattributed, the final payload used in this attack shares significant code overlaps
[Word Count: 12]

with BackShell and StealthPipes, two tools uniquely attributed to WET PANDA.
[Word Count: 11]

A second unattributed actor was observed in late 2023 distributing ShadowPad to
[Word Count: 12]

suspected Chinese-speaking targets as part of a likely supply chain compromise.
[Word Count: 11]

The actor compromised a China-based virtual conference platform and leveraged
[Word Count: 10]

the resulting access to deploy a trojanized ShadowPad installer masquerading
[Word Count: 10]

as a legitimate software tool. Though this activity is unattributed, ShadowPad is
[Word Count: 12]

exclusively used by China-nexus adversaries such as AQUATIC PANDA, WICKED
[Word Count: 10]

In early 2023, an unattributed actor likely compromised an update server
[Word Count: 11]

associated with iPhone i4Tools management software to deploy AvanteGarde, a
[Word Count: 10]

malware framework associated with China-nexus activity cluster InnateSpark.
[Word Count: 8]

Though CrowdStrike CAO was able to confirm at least 250 customers had
[Word Count: 12]

connected to the compromised update server, only 10% received the malicious
[Word Count: 11]

update, possibly indicating the actor down-selected high-value targets.
[Word Count: 8]

Threat Highlight: 
North Korea’s Supply Chain 
Compromises
[Word Count: 7]

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) adversaries also demonstrated
[Word Count: 9]

an increased interest in exploiting trusted relationships in 2023. In particular,
[Word Count: 11]

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA abused a trusted relationship between a technology
[Word Count: 9]

vendor and a client in three instances last year, highlighting an interest in using
[Word Count: 14]

supply chain compromises as an intrusion vector.
[Word Count: 7]

This exploitation tradecraft was first observed in March 2023, when an adversary
[Word Count: 12]

compromised software at VoIP provider 3CX. This compromise appears to have
[Word Count: 11]

started with an upstream supply chain compromise of financial technology firm
[Word Count: 11]

Trading Technologies. The adversary used trojanized 3CX Electron Windows
[Word Count: 9]

and macOS desktop application variants to deliver information stealers to victim
[Word Count: 11]

environments. The threat actors then persisted with a July 2023 campaign that
[Word Count: 12]

similarly abused access to a technology company in efforts to compromise its
[Word Count: 12]

product and use legitimate infrastructure to infiltrate the compromised
[Word Count: 9]

22
CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

CrowdStrike CAO also observed LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA distributing malware
[Word Count: 8]

via a trojanized CyberLink media player variant. This campaign stands out among
[Word Count: 12]

other LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA supply chain compromises, as the adversary used
[Word Count: 10]

execution guardrails that limited the campaign to a specific geography and
[Word Count: 11]

temporal window, suggesting the targeting of a particular victim set.
[Word Count: 10]

The motivation driving these compromises remains undefined. In one supply chain
[Word Count: 11]

compromise, CrowdStrike CAO detected trojanized software in the environments
[Word Count: 9]

of 62 customers; however, subsequent supply chain compromises were more
[Word Count: 10]

limited in scope. The adversary may be using supply chain compromises to cast a
[Word Count: 14]

wide net and deliver appropriate follow-on tooling to interesting targets.
[Word Count: 10]

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA is equally likely abusing trusted relationships between
[Word Count: 9]

suppliers and product users to infiltrate specific high-value targets for currency
[Word Count: 11]

generation and espionage campaigns. CrowdStrike CAO assesses that additional
[Word Count: 9]

LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA supply chain compromises are increasingly likely to occur
[Word Count: 10]

in the near future. The adversary likely considers supply chain compromise a
[Word Count: 12]

useful tactic with potential to streamline operations. This assessment is made
[Word Count: 11]

with moderate confidence based on the volume of supply chain compromises
[Word Count: 11]

Outlook: 
Third-Party Relationship Exploitation
[Word Count: 4]

Trusted-relationship compromises will continue to attract targeted intrusion actors in the immediate future.
[Word Count: 13]

The high ROI for these attacks, particularly in terms of access to potential downstream compromises relative
[Word Count: 16]

to the limited effort required to compromise one target, will likely motivate attacks throughout 2024.
[Word Count: 15]

Organizations operating in the technology sector are uniquely at risk from third-party relationship exploitation.
[Word Count: 14]

In 2023, nearly every trusted-relationship compromise originated as part of an intrusion at a technology sector
[Word Count: 16]

organization that provided commercial software.

2023 ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT: CYBER OPERATIONS
[Word Count: 5]

On October 7, 2023, Hamas military wing Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades (IDQB) and several other Gaza-based militant
[Word Count: 17]

groups launched a massive kinetic attack against Israel, killing hundreds of Israelis and taking hostages. In the ensuing
[Word Count: 18]

months, CrowdStrike CAO tracked ongoing cyber operations from targeted intrusion and hacktivist actors. Activity
[Word Count: 14]

and claims from both groups primarily focus on targeting operational technology or other critical systems — likely to
[Word Count: 18]

psychologically influence target populations — and deploying destructive wipers against Israeli or Israel-linked entities.
[Word Count: 14]

Most conflict-driven cyber operations observed include hacktivist activity and operations by suspected faketivists.
[Word Count: 13]

Within the context of the Israel-Hamas conflict, the dividing line between these two threat actor types has blurred,
[Word Count: 18]

as genuine hacktivist groups often amplify the claims of, or provide support to, likely state-nexus inauthentic personas.
[Word Count: 17]

Unmanaged network appliances — particularly edge gateway devices —
[Word Count: 9]

remained the most routinely observed initial access vector for exploitation during
[Word Count: 11]

2023. These devices are commonly based on obsolete architecture, leading to
[Word Count: 11]

broadly exploited vulnerabilities in firewall and VPN platforms from Cisco (CVE-
[Word Count: 11]

2023-20198), Citrix (CVE-2023-3519, CVE-2023-4966) and F5 (CVE-2023-46747).
[Word Count: 7]

Exploitation was also observed in various other unmanaged devices throughout
[Word Count: 10]

2023. Targeted intrusion actors likely engaged in opportunistic Ivanti mobile device
[Word Count: 11]

management application targeting via CVE-2023-35078 and CVE-2023-35082.
[Word Count: 7]

Akira ransomware operators leveraged exploits for CVE-2023-27532 — a
[Word Count: 9]

vulnerability in Veeam Backup & Replication — to pivot into victim backup storage
[Word Count: 13]

infrastructure. Additionally, eCrime actors developed zero-day exploits for
[Word Count: 8]

telephony products based on an abandoned open-source project.
[Word Count: 8]

The latter zero-day exploit relates to another trend observed in 2023: a focus
[Word Count: 13]

on EOL product exploitation. Threat actors are actively developing exploits for
[Word Count: 11]

EOL products that cannot be patched and often do not allow for modern sensor
[Word Count: 14]

deployment. Unsupported operating system (OS) servers and legacy gateway
[Word Count: 9]

appliances offer easy access — even to otherwise antiquated malware families —
[Word Count: 12]

leading to lingering infections that distract resources from contemporary security
[Word Count: 10]

Increasing defender visibility to such exploit vectors is key in mitigating the risk
[Word Count: 13]

posed by these tactics. CrowdStrike® Falcon Surface℠ can be leveraged to monitor
[Word Count: 12]

and reduce internet-exposed services and maintain an application inventory across
[Word Count: 10]

an organization’s attack surface. Defenders should prioritize patching exposed
[Word Count: 9]

products, particularly open-source platforms, when the products are subject to
[Word Count: 10]

known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. Finally, CrowdStrike Falcon®
[Word Count: 9]

Spotlight can determine whether sensor-deployed assets are subject to known
[Word Count: 10]

vulnerabilities and when these endpoints have reached EOL.

Though CrowdStrike CAO tracks multiple adversaries associated with the Hamas militant group, activity

CrowdStrike CAO-assessed, likely Gaza-based adversaries EXTREME JACKAL
[Word Count: 7]

and RENEGADE JACKAL demonstrate support for strategic Hamas interests.
[Word Count: 9]

Additionally, evidence suggests the CruelAlchemy activity cluster represents a
[Word Count: 9]

Hamas-linked cyber operations unit physically present in Turkey.
[Word Count: 8]

RENEGADE JACKAL was the most active Hamas-nexus adversary throughout
[Word Count: 9]

2023. The group primarily targeted Middle East-based government entities with
[Word Count: 10]

its custom Micropsia Windows malware and Android implants. In mid-October 2023,
[Word Count: 11]

CrowdStrike CAO linked RENEGADE JACKAL to the Jerusalem Electronic Army, an
[Word Count: 11]

ostensible hacktivist group Hamas officials previously indicated was in support
[Word Count: 10]

Open-source reporting identified activity, allegedly attributable to Hamas,
[Word Count: 8]

targeting Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) personnel. However, CrowdStrike CAO has
[Word Count: 10]

no further evidence to suggest the aforementioned adversaries are currently
[Word Count: 10]

targeting Israeli entities in connection with recent events in Israel and Gaza.3
[Word Count: 12]

Since the onset of the conflict, internet connectivity in the Gaza Strip has been
[Word Count: 14]

significantly degraded almost certainly due to a combination of kinetic activity,
[Word Count: 11]

power outages and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
[Word Count: 7]

Power and internet disruptions have likely hindered Gaza-based adversary
[Word Count: 9]

operations. Though no CruelAlchemy activity has been observed in direct
[Word Count: 10]

association with the Israel-Hamas conflict, identified command-and-control
[Word Count: 7]

Aerial Projectile Warning Systems 
and Critical Infrastructure Targeting
[Word Count: 8]

Multiple hacktivist entities have targeted aerial projectile warning systems in Israel
[Word Count: 11]

and claimed to have disrupted IDF counter-rocket, artillery and mortar systems
[Word Count: 11]

to prevent notification delivery and/or send false imminent attack notifications to
[Word Count: 11]

Israeli citizens. Observed targeting of these services decreased after mid-October
[Word Count: 10]

2023; however, a surge of kinetic activity in the region could ignite a renewed
[Word Count: 14]

interest in further disruption or false notifications.
[Word Count: 7]

Throughout the duration of the conflict, pro-Palestine hacktivists have consistently
[Word Count: 10]

targeted critical infrastructure in Israel, including disruptive activity against
[Word Count: 9]

energy-distribution infrastructure and water pumps, DDoS attacks against utility
[Word Count: 9]

companies, and hack-and-leak operations against water treatment and energy
[Word Count: 9]

plants. This activity is likely an attempt to inflict physical and psychological
[Word Count: 12]

damage on Israeli citizens and will likely continue throughout the duration of the
[Word Count: 13]

Israel-Hamas conflict. This assessment is made with high confidence based on
[Word Count: 11]

consistent targeting to date and similar activity observed in other recent conflicts,
[Word Count: 12]

Operations Beyond the Immediate 
Conflict Region
[Word Count: 6]

Limited hacktivist activity extended beyond the immediate conflict area in
[Word Count: 10]

retaliation against real or perceived support of Israel. On October 12, 2023, Yemeni
[Word Count: 13]

group Team R70 claimed a DDoS attack against a U.S.-based airport, alleging the
[Word Count: 13]

airport receives the most Israeli air traffic.
[Word Count: 7]

On October 14, 2023, prominent South Asian hacktivist group Team Insane
[Word Count: 11]

Pakistan claimed a DDoS attack against a British military website. This activity was

On October 16, 2023, a likely Indonesian hacktivist group calling itself INFINITE
[Word Count: 12]

INSIGHT shared leaked data, claiming to have breached the personally identifiable
[Word Count: 11]

information (PII) of nearly 790,000 doctors in the United States. The alleged leak
[Word Count: 13]

was reportedly in retaliation against U.S. support for Israel as well as to show
[Word Count: 14]

Hacktivists will likely continue limited targeting of countries and entities beyond
[Word Count: 11]

the conflict region that they perceive as supporting Israel. This assessment
[Word Count: 11]

is made with high confidence based on consistent activity observed to date
[Word Count: 12]

and in similar conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as observed

Outlook: 
Cyber Operations in the Conflict
[Word Count: 6]

Unlike in the Russia-Ukraine war, where known cyber operations have directly contributed to the conflict,
[Word Count: 15]

those involved in the Israel-Hamas conflict have not directly contributed to Hamas’ military operations against
[Word Count: 15]

Israel. The full breadth and effects of activity targeting Israel, particularly by Iranian state-nexus adversaries
[Word Count: 15]

and allied proxies, are almost certainly not fully known. However, identified incidents have largely been
[Word Count: 15]

misaligned with early concerns that Iranian cyberattacks could cause significant disruptions across critical
[Word Count: 13]

sectors in Israel and broaden in scope to allied countries. This misalignment may point to Iranian forces’
[Word Count: 17]

incapability or lack of preparedness and their desire to avoid an unintended escalation that could draw Iran
[Word Count: 17]

CrowdStrike CAO tracks activity clusters SpoiledMocha and Moonshuttle. These are reportedly aligned with
[Word Count: 13]

Iran’s regional proxies — the Houthi movement in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon, respectively — even
[Word Count: 16]

though these entities have not yet been observed within the Israel-Hamas conflict context.
[Word Count: 13]

Pro-Iraqi Shia militia hacktivist groups have demonstrated consistent involvement in targeting Israeli entities
[Word Count: 13]

since the onset of the conflict. An escalation in kinetic hostilities could lead to related activity from these
[Word Count: 18]

Hacktivist activity will almost certainly continue apace with fluctuations in related geopolitical developments.
[Word Count: 13]

This assessment is made with high confidence based on the activity patterns exhibited to date as well as
[Word Count: 18]

consistent patterns observed across other similar conflicts.

As organizations plan for potential threats emerging in 2024, two
[Word Count: 10]

potential disruption drivers come to the forefront: generative AI and
[Word Count: 10]

Generative AI Use Within 
the Threat Landscape
[Word Count: 7]

Mainstream accessible generative AI technology exploded in late 2022,
[Word Count: 9]

opening up a new realm of possibilities for efficient content creation and
[Word Count: 12]

drawing the attention of adversaries seeking ways to exploit this new
[Word Count: 11]

Generative AI has massively democratized computing to improve
[Word Count: 8]

adversary operations. It can also potentially lower the entry barrier to
[Word Count: 11]

the threat landscape for less sophisticated threat actors.
[Word Count: 8]

Two primary generative AI opportunity areas within the threat
[Word Count: 9]

►
Developing and/or executing malicious computer network
[Word Count: 7]

operations (CNO), including tool and resource development such as
[Word Count: 9]

scripts or code that could be functionally malicious if used correctly
[Word Count: 11]

►
Supporting the efficiency and effectiveness of social engineering
[Word Count: 9]

Generative AI in Malicious 
Computer Network Operations
[Word Count: 7]

It’s difficult to confidently gauge the probability of adversaries
[Word Count: 9]

using newer technologies such as generative AI in their operations,
[Word Count: 10]

particularly in relation to how these technologies will support malicious
[Word Count: 10]

CNO. Only rare concrete observations included likely adversary use of
[Word Count: 10]

generative AI during some operational phases.
[Word Count: 6]

CrowdStrike’s visibility into the use of such tools is likely incomplete.
[Word Count: 11]

This is either a result of limited observations, the fact that the AI-
[Word Count: 13]

generated material did not intrinsically leave significant indicators of its
[Word Count: 10]

true nature or adversaries taking steps to avoid revealing evidence that
[Word Count: 11]

Throughout 2023, generative AI was rarely observed supporting
[Word Count: 8]

malicious CNO development and/or execution.
[Word Count: 5]

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

In February 2023, CrowdStrike Services responded to an
[Word Count: 8]

INDRIK SPIDER incident involving BITWISE SPIDER’s LockBit
[Word Count: 7]

RED ransomware. During this incident, INDRIK SPIDER
[Word Count: 7]

exfiltrated credentials from cloud-based credential manager
[Word Count: 6]

Azure Key Vault. Logs show that INDRIK SPIDER also visited
[Word Count: 10]

ChatGPT while interacting with the Azure Portal.
[Word Count: 7]

In addition to visiting ChatGPT while browsing the Azure
[Word Count: 9]

Portal — presumably to understand how to navigate in
[Word Count: 9]

Azure — browsing activity analysis indicates INDRIK SPIDER
[Word Count: 8]

used search engines such as Google and Bing and searched
[Word Count: 10]

on GitHub during the operations to understand how to
[Word Count: 9]

Using search engines and visiting ChatGPT indicate that
[Word Count: 8]

though INDRIK SPIDER is likely new to the cloud and not yet
[Word Count: 12]

sophisticated in this domain, it is using generative AI to fill
[Word Count: 11]

In the second half of 2023, SCATTERED SPIDER used the
[Word Count: 10]

Azure AD PowerShell module to download all Entra ID
[Word Count: 9]

user immutable IDs at a North American financial services
[Word Count: 9]

victim. Using its Entra ID backdoor, the adversary could log
[Word Count: 10]

in as any of the downloaded users. The PowerShell used
[Word Count: 10]

to download the users’ immutable IDs resembled large
[Word Count: 8]

language model (LLM) outputs such as those from ChatGPT.
[Word Count: 9]

In particular, the pattern of one comment, the actual
[Word Count: 9]

command and then a new line for each command
[Word Count: 9]

Based on the similar code style, SCATTERED SPIDER
[Word Count: 8]

likely relied on an LLM to generate the PowerShell script

2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

Generative AI in Social Engineering  
and Information Operations
[Word Count: 8]

In recent years, certain language models have been able to compose fictional stories5 and generate digital
[Word Count: 16]

artwork.6 Since at least mid-2021, CrowdStrike has frequently reported on alleged research interest in highly
[Word Count: 15]

deceptive AI-fabricated images, audio and video (aka “deepfakes”) by Russia, China and Iran. Researchers
[Word Count: 14]

and academics have further speculated that threat actors will almost certainly use generative AI tools in
[Word Count: 16]

information and influence operations in the near future.7
[Word Count: 8]

These speculations began actualizing in 2023: A Chinese information operations campaign, likely reliant
[Word Count: 13]

on images produced by generative AI (specifically diffusion-model-generated images), gained authentic
[Word Count: 11]

engagement across several prominent social media platforms throughout September. Beyond state-nexus
[Word Count: 11]

actors, CrowdStrike also observed a hacktivist group attempting to create a spam tool using generative AI as
[Word Count: 17]

part of its efforts to disseminate pro-Azerbaijan messaging.
[Word Count: 8]

Generative AI has potential for use in numerous fields not likely identified or popularized in mainstream public
[Word Count: 17]

discourse. AI’s continuous development will undoubtedly increase the potency of its potential misuse —
[Word Count: 14]

particularly within the scope of information operations and especially for less digitally literate audiences. The
[Word Count: 15]

degree to which popular generative AI tools can be used maliciously will likely adapt over time as companies,
[Word Count: 18]

tool owners and governments respond to new developments and perceived misuse.
[Word Count: 11]

CrowdStrike CAO assesses that generative AI will likely be used for cyber activities in 2024 as the technology
[Word Count: 18]

continues to gain popularity. The team will track exactly how threat actors use this technology, and how this
[Word Count: 18]

use differs from mainstream applications, throughout 2024. This type of research includes examinations of
[Word Count: 14]

►
The potential that adversaries will use publicly available or open-source LLMs, which will likely require
[Word Count: 16]

continual adversary navigation around safeguards against malicious or illegal activity (e.g., jailbreaking).
[Word Count: 12]

►
Adversaries’ attempts to develop their own models or generative AI tools that require less prompt
[Word Count: 16]

engineering. Notably, the cost of training LLMs can significantly deter their independent, illicit
[Word Count: 13]

development. Threat actors’ attempts to craft and use such models in 2023 frequently amounted to scams
[Word Count: 16]

that created relatively poor outputs and, in many cases, quickly became defunct.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

In 2024, individuals from 55 countries representing more than 42% of the global
[Word Count: 13]

population will participate in presidential, parliamentary and/or general elections.
[Word Count: 9]

This includes seven of the 10 most populous countries in the world: India, the U.S.,
[Word Count: 15]

Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia and Mexico. High-profile, national-level
[Word Count: 8]

elections will also occur in countries or groups involved in, or proximal to, major
[Word Count: 14]

geopolitical conflicts. These include Taiwan, Azerbaijan, India, Pakistan, Iran, Belarus,
[Word Count: 10]

Russia, Finland, Lithuania and the European Union.
[Word Count: 7]

2024’s potential to transform geopolitics around the globe for the near future will
[Word Count: 13]

likely give adversaries numerous opportunities, and a considerable strategic impetus,
[Word Count: 10]

to target entities involved in electoral processes throughout the coming year.
[Word Count: 11]

Cyber activity targeting elections can range from direct attempts to disrupt electoral
[Word Count: 12]

processes to more indirect efforts to sway voter opinion toward outcomes preferred
[Word Count: 12]

by the adversary.8 The most direct, but least frequent, targeting involves intrusions
[Word Count: 12]

against the software and hardware used to record, tally, count and transmit votes in
[Word Count: 14]

voting systems. This form of election interference can range from using computer
[Word Count: 12]

network attacks to intentionally disrupt, degrade or destroy voting systems to using
[Word Count: 12]

privileged access or vulnerabilities to attempt to alter vote counts without detection.
[Word Count: 12]

Less direct forms of targeted intrusion can involve attempts to compromise, disrupt
[Word Count: 12]

access to or leak data from government systems that provide logistical information to
[Word Count: 13]

voters, store voter registration data or otherwise support transparent and democratic
[Word Count: 11]

election conduct. These targeted intrusion efforts include using DDoS attacks or
[Word Count: 11]

website defacements against local, municipal, provincial and state government
[Word Count: 9]

systems, a tactic historically favored by hacktivists seeking to espouse their
[Word Count: 11]

viewpoints during tense political moments. Other parties involved in elections —
[Word Count: 11]

such as political candidates, parties, donors and advocacy groups — can also be
[Word Count: 13]

targeted in a variety of ways, including via the use of hack-and-leak operations
[Word Count: 13]

often designed to publicly discredit the target.
[Word Count: 7]

The least direct type of election targeting — but almost certainly the most
[Word Count: 13]

common and typically the most difficult to prevent — involves distributing mis- or
[Word Count: 13]

disinformation to electorates before, during and after voting processes in an effort
[Word Count: 12]

These information operations can take many forms. One common theme involves
[Word Count: 11]

attempts to generate disruptive narratives — for example, they may undermine public
[Word Count: 12]

confidence in election outcomes, enhance perceptions that specific political parties
[Word Count: 10]

or individuals are corrupt, impugn candidates’ personal character or disseminate
[Word Count: 10]

inflammatory and polarizing social rhetoric. Other operations may aim to reinforce
[Word Count: 11]

perspectives that portray the threat actor responsible in a more positive light;
[Word Count: 12]

for example, as an advocate for specific policy positions beneficial to that entity
[Word Count: 13]

or representative of cooperation or coexistence rhetoric.
[Word Count: 7]

Though this section details the actions of external malicious actors targeting elections, it is worth

Threat Highlight: 
Iranian Targeting of U.S. 
Elections in 2020
[Word Count: 9]

In late October 2020, a few weeks before the last U.S. presidential election cycle,
[Word Count: 14]

Iranian threat actors conducted varied targeted IO against U.S. entities. They sent
[Word Count: 12]

threatening emails to voters, alleging to represent a far-right U.S. political group
[Word Count: 12]

and directing recipients to vote for a specific candidate. Iranian threat actors also
[Word Count: 13]

disseminated a video falsely alleging to depict overseas actors fabricating ballots,
[Word Count: 11]

implying one particular political party would seek to exploit security vulnerabilities
[Word Count: 11]

The most common malicious activities targeting elections have historically
[Word Count: 9]

involved information operations likely conducted by state-nexus entities against
[Word Count: 9]

citizens of countries that hold specific geopolitical interest to the threat actor
[Word Count: 12]

and simple, short-lived hacktivism — including DDoS attacks and website
[Word Count: 10]

defacements — against state and local government entities. This trend is

In 2024, countries of interest involved in election
[Word Count: 8]

cycles will likely be at risk of significant and lengthy IO
[Word Count: 11]

campaigns from major global powers. Russia and Iran
[Word Count: 8]

will likely leverage IO against the U.S. and the EU, which
[Word Count: 11]

they consider major geopolitical opponents.
[Word Count: 5]

China will also likely conduct IO against elections held
[Word Count: 9]

in its perceived regional sphere of influence, such as
[Word Count: 9]

those in Indonesia, South Korea and Taiwan. Russia will
[Word Count: 9]

almost certainly behave similarly in elections occurring

[Word Count: 8]

Pakistan are highly likely to conduct significant IO
[Word Count: 8]

campaigns against one another during their respective
[Word Count: 7]

elections in April and February 2024, particularly given
[Word Count: 8]

the current political upheaval and polarization in both
[Word Count: 8]

Given the ease with which AI tools can generate
[Word Count: 9]

deceptive but convincing narratives, adversaries will
[Word Count: 6]

highly likely use such tools to conduct IO against
[Word Count: 9]

elections in 2024. Politically active partisans within those
[Word Count: 8]

countries holding elections will also likely use generative
[Word Count: 8]

AI to create disinformation to disseminate within their
[Word Count: 8]

These issues were already observed within the
[Word Count: 7]

first few weeks of 2024, as Chinese actors used
[Word Count: 9]

AI-generated content in social media influence campaigns
[Word Count: 7]

to disseminate content critical of Taiwan presidential
[Word Count: 7]

The overall polarization of the political spectrum in many
[Word Count: 9]

countries amid continuing economic and social issues
[Word Count: 7]

will likely increase the susceptibility of those countries’
[Word Count: 8]

citizenries to IO — particularly IO campaigns targeted at
[Word Count: 9]

reinforcing those individuals’ negative opinions of political
[Word Count: 7]

Additionally, changes to or staff reductions affecting the
[Word Count: 8]

enforceability of content moderation policies at major
[Word Count: 7]

social media companies will likely provide opportunities
[Word Count: 7]

for adversary exploitation using these platforms to

Though the average ransom demand was lower in 2023 than in 2022, this highly

likely represents an outlier in the dataset and not an accurate view of the threat

landscape. Ransom demands have likely remained consistently high throughout
[Word Count: 9]

this period, but the ability to track these values is becoming challenging due to
[Word Count: 14]

threat actors and victims implementing stricter privacy measures around ransom

[Word Count: 12]

in 2023, with 4,615 victim posts made to DLSs — a 76% increase over 2022.
[Word Count: 15]

Several factors contributed to this growth, including newly emerged BGH

adversaries, growth of existing adversary operations and select high-volume

The adversary had previously monetized intrusions by selling victim data and SIM
[Word Count: 12]

swaps as well as stealing cryptocurrency. Adopting ransomware as its primary
[Word Count: 11]

means of extortion has shifted the scope of the adversary’s target profile: Most
[Word Count: 13]

SCATTERED SPIDER victims in 2023 can be categorized as either reconnaissance
[Word Count: 11]

targets or monetization targets. Reconnaissance targets are typically organizations
[Word Count: 9]

in the business process outsourcing, customer relationship management, customer
[Word Count: 9]

experience, technology and telecom sectors. SCATTERED SPIDER uses intrusions
[Word Count: 9]

into these entities’ networks to identify data that may prove useful in downstream,
[Word Count: 13]

The adversary’s monetization target profile is considerably broader. Most directly
[Word Count: 10]

observed targets include high-revenue — often Fortune 500 — U.S.-based private

sector entities. A notable uptick in North American financial services victims

In January 2023, a coordinated international law enforcement operation resulted in
[Word Count: 11]

the seizure of HIVE SPIDER infrastructure and acquisition of the Hive ransomware
[Word Count: 12]

decryption key. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly maintained
[Word Count: 11]

access to HIVE SPIDER’s internal infrastructure since July 2022 and has since
[Word Count: 12]

provided decryption keys to more than 300 worldwide victims, preventing
[Word Count: 10]

ransom payments totaling 130 million USD. No HIVE SPIDER activity has been
[Word Count: 12]

observed since January 2023; however, Hive affiliates have since migrated to other
[Word Count: 12]

ransomware as a service (RaaS) operations.
[Word Count: 6]

In February and September 2023, law enforcement issued sanctions against

WIZARD SPIDER members aiming to restrict the named individuals’ finances, travel,
[Word Count: 11]

[Word Count: 11]

connected to an unnamed ransomware actor. Finally, in December 2023, the FBI
[Word Count: 12]

seized ALPHA SPIDER’s infrastructure, including the Alphv DLS — ransomware
[Word Count: 10]

SCATTERED SPIDER used throughout most of 2023.
[Word Count: 7]

The FBI offered an Alphv decryption tool to more than 500 ALPHA SPIDER victims,
[Word Count: 14]

prompting ALPHA SPIDER to migrate its DLS and affiliate panel to new Tor sites
[Word Count: 14]

while it attempted to regain control of its compromised infrastructure. ALPHA

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

Since 2019, BGH adversaries have threatened to publish stolen data on DLSs as
[Word Count: 13]

a secondary extortion means in concert with deploying ransomware.12 In 2023,
[Word Count: 11]

adversaries continued to invent exploitation methods to steal victim data and
[Word Count: 11]

increase pressure on victims, with many — including GRACEFUL SPIDER and
[Word Count: 11]

MASKED SPIDER — adopting data theft as their sole means of extortion.
[Word Count: 12]

GRACEFUL SPIDER was the most prolific data theft and extortion actor in 2023.
[Word Count: 13]

The adversary exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in file-transfer applications
[Word Count: 8]

GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer and MOVEit Transfer as well as IT
[Word Count: 11]

management software SysAid On-Premise. GRACEFUL SPIDER’s Clop ransomware
[Word Count: 8]

deployment within the scope of these campaigns was not observed, although the
[Word Count: 12]

adversary exfiltrated and published data to its DLS that belonged to more than
[Word Count: 13]

380 victim organizations. To allow broader audience access to leaks, GRACEFUL
[Word Count: 11]

SPIDER also published victim data on clearweb domains, a technique first used by
[Word Count: 13]

BGH adversaries have historically and indiscriminately exfiltrated and published
[Word Count: 9]

stolen victim data. In 2023, these threat actors demonstrated greater focus on
[Word Count: 12]

stolen data in efforts to maximize pressure on victims, as shown by the following:
[Word Count: 14]

►
Publishing victim Domain Admin credentials and system IP addresses on the
[Word Count: 12]

Black Basta RaaS DLS. This data could be leveraged by distinct threat actors to
[Word Count: 14]

►
Creating separate victim posts for third-party organizations whose data was
[Word Count: 11]

identified in the victim network but were not subjected to compromises.
[Word Count: 11]

►
Multiple RaaS affiliates compromised mental and physical healthcare entities
[Word Count: 10]

and highlighted their access to — and provided previews of — sensitive data
[Word Count: 13]

and records, including patient photos, in DLS posts.
[Word Count: 8]

►
VICE SPIDER continued to use a PS script to automate data exfiltration
[Word Count: 13]

but customized the script to search for directory and filenames containing
[Word Count: 11]

strings such as *violence*, *abuse*, *Theft*, *Stealing*,
[Word Count: 7]

*humiliation*, *harassment* and *death*, likely to identify data that
[Word Count: 9]

posed a high potential for embarrassing victim organizations.
[Word Count: 8]

Many adversaries, including GRACEFUL SPIDER and MASKED SPIDER, have
[Word Count: 9]

struggled with cryptographic flaws in their ransomware that enable trivial
[Word Count: 10]

decryption under specific conditions. In contrast, data theft and extortion offer
[Word Count: 11]

BGH actors an easier route to monetization, and many simply steal data from a
[Word Count: 14]

single host or public-facing application. CrowdStrike CAO assesses that BGH
[Word Count: 10]

adversaries will likely continue to become more targeted in their pursuit of data
[Word Count: 13]

with a high potential for embarrassing victims.

The record number of victims named on DLSs throughout 2023 demonstrates
[Word Count: 11]

BGH’s status as the current most significant eCrime threat to organizations across
[Word Count: 12]

all geographical regions and industries. This increase is driven by various factors,
[Word Count: 12]

including GRACEFUL SPIDER’s zero-day exploitation campaigns, BGH adversaries’
[Word Count: 8]

continued targeting of unmanaged devices — such as edge gateway devices
[Word Count: 11]

for initial access and targeting VMware ESXi for encryption — and an increasing
[Word Count: 13]

number of adversaries naming victims following data theft incidents that did not
[Word Count: 12]

Though CrowdStrike CAO assesses that ransomware will highly likely remain
[Word Count: 10]

the primary extortion method through 2024, BGH adversaries will increasingly
[Word Count: 10]

emphasize stolen-data exploitation as a means to pressure victims into payment.
[Word Count: 11]

This is particularly true as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules
[Word Count: 12]

impact major cybersecurity incident disclosures.13
[Word Count: 5]

SCATTERED SPIDER’s Alphv ransomware underscored the effectiveness of
[Word Count: 8]

extortion as a tactic throughout 2023. Though SCATTERED SPIDER previously
[Word Count: 10]

monetized campaigns through cryptocurrency theft and SIM swaps, ransomware
[Word Count: 9]

is a more opportunistic tactic, enabling the adversary to broaden its target
[Word Count: 12]

scope. Barring any successful law enforcement activity targeting the adversary,
[Word Count: 10]

SCATTERED SPIDER will highly likely remain a critical threat to high-revenue
[Word Count: 11]

private sector entities in 2024, particularly those based in Europe and North
[Word Count: 12]

Coordinated international law enforcement operations targeted BGH actors in
[Word Count: 9]

2023. These included adversary personnel arrests, technical action against
[Word Count: 9]

various capabilities, cryptocurrency seizure and sanctioning of named individuals.
[Word Count: 9]

The disruption of HIVE SPIDER’s Hive RaaS and MALLARD SPIDER’s enabling QakBot

malware left voids that were quickly filled by competing RaaS and malware as a

Malware Delivery Trends Following 
Mark-of-the-Web Patch on ISO Files

Adversaries in 2023 experimented with malware delivery methods that do not
[Word Count: 11]

rely on macros or ISO files, following a sharp increase in ISO files being used for
[Word Count: 16]

malware delivery and a subsequent patch by Microsoft for a Mark-of-the-Web

[Word Count: 7]

The number of malware campaigns using malicious OneNote files for initial

access rose significantly14 between late December 2022 and March 2023, with
[Word Count: 11]

the technique’s earliest adopters including criminals distributing information
[Word Count: 8]

stealers and commodity malware. By mid-January 2023, large-scale malware
[Word Count: 9]

distributors such as LUNAR SPIDER, HONEY SPIDER and MALLARD SPIDER began
[Word Count: 11]

using OneNote files as a primary malware distribution method. In March 2023,
[Word Count: 12]

Microsoft announced a change that would prevent file types commonly abused by
[Word Count: 12]

adversaries from being embedded in OneNote files.15 Following the announcement,
[Word Count: 10]

the popularity of OneNote files within adversary campaigns rapidly declined.
[Word Count: 10]

Though no one technique has emerged as a front-runner to replace OneNote files,
[Word Count: 13]

adversaries continue to experiment with malware delivery methods. Adversaries
[Word Count: 9]

such as LUNAR SPIDER, APOTHECARY SPIDER and HERMIT SPIDER have
[Word Count: 10]

consistently used malvertising and search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning.
[Word Count: 9]

Adversaries reliant on spam campaigns use multiple techniques and file types to
[Word Count: 12]

deliver malware. Several adversaries have used PDF files containing links to files
[Word Count: 12]

hosted on external URLs as well as HTML smuggling. More novel techniques
[Word Count: 12]

have included using WebDAV files to distribute payloads. Toward the end of
[Word Count: 12]

2023, multiple malware families were distributed in new lures containing fake
[Word Count: 11]

Malvertising is a technique in which threat actors create malicious advertisements
[Word Count: 11]

to facilitate criminal activity. Adversaries use SEO poisoning to falsely promote
[Word Count: 11]

malicious websites to higher ranks in search engine results. Similar to malvertising,
[Word Count: 12]

SEO poisoning relies on users believing the results closest to the top of a search
[Word Count: 15]

Throughout 2023, adversaries such as LUNAR SPIDER regularly abused Google

The rise of macOS malware and the evolution of malware delivery techniques
[Word Count: 12]

demonstrate the eCrime ecosystem’s innovative nature. Furthermore, eCrime
[Word Count: 8]

enablers regularly copy successful tactics used by other criminal actors, as made

evident by the increase of OneNote files for malware delivery.
[Word Count: 10]

eCrime enablers will highly likely continue to innovate and offer new products on
[Word Count: 13]

criminal marketplaces in 2024. This assessment is made with high confidence
[Word Count: 11]

based on historical trends in the eCrime ecosystem. Malware delivery trends will
[Word Count: 12]

likely continue to fluctuate, with SEO poisoning and malvertising remaining popular

Adversaries Continue Legitimate 
RMM Tool Use
[Word Count: 6]

Throughout 2023, multiple targeted eCrime adversaries — particularly CHEF SPIDER, DISTANT SPIDER and SOLAR
[Word Count: 14]

SPIDER — heavily used legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools.
[Word Count: 11]

Starting in March 2023, CHEF SPIDER adopted sophisticated social engineering tactics to direct victims to download
[Word Count: 16]

Inno Setup and ClickOnce installers for RMM tool ConnectWise ScreenConnect. Though CHEF SPIDER has historically
[Word Count: 15]

targeted point-of-sale systems in the hospitality sector by compromising internet-facing servers, the adversary gradually
[Word Count: 14]

shifted to targeting U.S.-based hospitality sector service providers, financial service providers and digital marketing firms
[Word Count: 15]

In 2023, DISTANT SPIDER — which universally relies on ConnectWise ScreenConnect — continued deploying MSI
[Word Count: 15]

installers (aka Windows Installers) for this legitimate RMM tool after exploiting vulnerable internet-facing servers within
[Word Count: 15]

victim environments. In September 2023, an earlier DISTANT SPIDER ConnectWise ScreenConnect intrusion likely
[Word Count: 13]

enabled an ALPHA SPIDER affiliate to exfiltrate data and demand a ransom from a victim.
[Word Count: 15]

In June 2023, SOLAR SPIDER likely used phishing emails to direct victims to download a ZIP archive hosted on GitHub.
[Word Count: 20]

This archive contained a loader that abuses DLL search-order hijacking to run the legitimate RMM Remote Management
[Word Count: 17]

System tool. SOLAR SPIDER has used the legitimate RMM tool NetSupport Manager since at least October 2022.

AVIATOR SPIDER, BLIND SPIDER and ODYSSEY SPIDER all used ROBOT
[Word Count: 10]

SPIDER’s Fsociety crypter service during 2023. Fsociety tools typically consist of
[Word Count: 11]

a set of scripts that download and execute an intermediate .NET payload that
[Word Count: 13]

subsequently loads a final RAT payload in memory. Throughout 2023, ROBOT
[Word Count: 11]

SPIDER continued to update the Fsociety crypter to improve obfuscation and add

capabilities. Generally, infection chains leveraging Fsociety culminated in commodity
[Word Count: 9]

ODYSSEY SPIDER, which is likely based in Brazil, uses ROBOT SPIDER’s Fsociety
[Word Count: 12]

crypter service along with other commodity crypters and RATs. ODYSSEY
[Word Count: 10]

SPIDER predominantly focuses on the travel and hospitality sectors in LATAM and
[Word Count: 12]

Southeastern Europe, specifically aiming to monetize payment card details entered
[Word Count: 10]

during travel-related booking processes. However, in Q3 2023, the adversary
[Word Count: 10]

began targeting numerous other sectors and regions, likely while leveraging local
[Word Count: 11]

SQUAB SPIDER primarily targets financial institutions, particularly but not
[Word Count: 9]

exclusively those based in Mexico. The adversary achieves initial access by
[Word Count: 11]

exploiting web servers to deploy a wide set of webshells. From there, threat
[Word Count: 13]

actors rely on passive BLUEAGAVE bind shells or simple listeners to enable lateral
[Word Count: 13]

movement through a network and to generally avoid conventional C2 traffic.
[Word Count: 11]

SQUAB SPIDER likely attempts to steal transaction-related data from victims.
[Word Count: 10]

Though opportunistic BGH campaigns remain the primary eCrime threat across
[Word Count: 10]

all sectors, a smaller eCrime actor subset will likely continue targeted eCrime
[Word Count: 12]

campaigns seeking to steal payment card- or transaction-related data from
[Word Count: 10]

victims. As with the BGH ecosystem, legitimate RMM tools will likely remain
[Word Count: 12]

popular among targeted eCrime operations due to their widespread use within

normal business processes. The endurance of LATAM-focused adversaries BLIND

the targeted intrusion, eCrime and hacktivist landscapes operating with
[Word Count: 9]

unprecedented stealth. The ability to operate undetected remains paramount for
[Word Count: 10]

malicious actors, and today’s sophisticated cybercriminals continue to discover

SCATTERED SPIDER and GRACEFUL SPIDER accounting for most activity.
[Word Count: 9]

CrowdStrike CAO assesses BGH will continue to pose the dominant threat within

the eCrime landscape in 2024. This assessment is made with high confidence
[Word Count: 12]

based on the continued success of these operations, as observed in the 76%
[Word Count: 13]

growth in DLS posts in 2023. Trends likely to be observed in 2024 in support of

BGH operations include ransomware-free data leak operations and an increase in
[Word Count: 11]

The number of cloud-conscious threat actors continued to grow in 2023 — as
[Word Count: 13]

in 2022 — and will highly likely continue to grow in 2024. Adversaries are highly
[Word Count: 15]

motivated to invest in and use cloud and other new technologies, such as
[Word Count: 13]

generative AI, to increase the efficiency and success of their operations. Cloud-
[Word Count: 12]

aware adversaries will look to detect, enumerate and navigate cloud environments
[Word Count: 11]

to harvest valuable proprietary information from Microsoft 365, SharePoint and
[Word Count: 10]

code repositories. They will use this information in ongoing operations and ransom
[Word Count: 12]

negotiations or simply sell it to other eCrime adversaries.
[Word Count: 9]

Financially motivated adversaries also increasingly realized the benefits of
[Word Count: 9]

dedicated relationships in 2023 and were likely able to increase resulting
[Word Count: 11]

operational success rates. Access brokers and RaaS actors will likely continue
[Word Count: 11]

to forge dedicated relationships in 2024. The coming year will also likely include

2023 trends — namely, edge device and EOL product targeting — will persist in
[Word Count: 14]

2024. eCrime threat actors remained the primary threat to most mobile users in
[Word Count: 13]

2023 and will likely continue as such in 2024. Targeted intrusion actors will also
[Word Count: 14]

almost certainly continue to target mobile devices, with increases in platform
[Word Count: 11]

and device security causing less sophisticated adversaries to struggle to operate
[Word Count: 11]

With the creation of Counter Adversary Operations, CrowdStrike remains steadfast
[Word Count: 10]

in its mission to stop breaches. Combining best-in-class threat intelligence with
[Word Count: 11]

a professional, managed threat hunting service unlike anything else offered in
[Word Count: 11]

the industry, CrowdStrike ensures its customers can access industry-leading
[Word Count: 9]

information to drive their individual operational success.
[Word Count: 7]

CrowdStrike CAO remained focused on disrupting the adversary in 2023 and will
[Word Count: 12]

continue to deliver unparalleled threat intelligence in 2024 and beyond.

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

Due to high success rates, identity-based and social engineering attacks surged in 2023.
[Word Count: 13]

Stolen credentials grant adversaries swift access and control — an instant gateway to a
[Word Count: 14]

breach. To counter these threats, it is essential to implement phishing-resistant multifactor
[Word Count: 12]

authentication and extend it to legacy systems and protocols, educate teams on social
[Word Count: 13]

engineering and implement technology that can detect and correlate threats across identity,
[Word Count: 12]

endpoint and cloud environments. Cross-domain visibility and enforcement enables security
[Word Count: 10]

teams to detect lateral movement, get full attack path visibility and hunt for malicious use
[Word Count: 15]

of legitimate tools. Addressing sophisticated access methods such as SIM swapping,
[Word Count: 11]

MFA bypass and the theft of API keys, session cookies and Kerberos tickets requires
[Word Count: 14]

proactive and continuous hunting for malicious behavior.
[Word Count: 7]

Prioritize cloud-native application 
protection platforms (CNAPPs)
[Word Count: 6]

Cloud adoption is exploding as companies realize the potential for innovation and
[Word Count: 12]

business agility that the cloud offers. Due to this growth, the cloud is rapidly becoming a
[Word Count: 16]

major battleground for cyberattacks. Businesses need full cloud visibility, including into
[Word Count: 11]

applications and APIs, to eliminate misconfigurations, vulnerabilities and other security threats.
[Word Count: 11]

CNAPPs are critical: Cloud security tools shouldn’t exist in isolation, and CNAPPs provide a
[Word Count: 14]

unified platform that simplifies monitoring, detecting and acting on potential cloud security
[Word Count: 12]

threats and vulnerabilities. Select a CNAPP that includes pre-runtime protection, runtime
[Word Count: 11]

protection and agentless technology to help you discover and map your apps and APIs running
[Word Count: 15]

in production, showing you all attack surfaces, threats and critical business risks.
[Word Count: 12]

Gain visibility across the most critical 
areas of enterprise risk
[Word Count: 10]

Adversaries often use valid credentials to access cloud-facing victim environments and then
[Word Count: 12]

use legitimate tools to execute their attack, making it difficult for defenders to differentiate
[Word Count: 14]

between normal user activity and a breach. To identify this type of attack, you need to
[Word Count: 16]

understand the relationship between identity, cloud, endpoint and data protection telemetry,
[Word Count: 11]

which may be in separate systems. In fact, the average enterprise uses 45+ security tools,
[Word Count: 15]

creating data silos and gaps in visibility. By consolidating into a unified security platform with
[Word Count: 15]

AI capabilities, organizations have complete visibility in one place and can easily control their
[Word Count: 14]

operations. With a consolidated security platform, organizations save time and money and can
[Word Count: 13]

quickly and confidently discover, identify and stop breaches.
[Word Count: 8]

CROWDSTRIKE 2024 GLOBAL THREAT REPORT
[Word Count: 6]

Drive efficiency: Adversaries are 
getting faster — are you?
[Word Count: 9]

It takes adversaries an average of 62 minutes — and the fastest only 2 minutes — to move
[Word Count: 18]

laterally from an initially compromised host to another host within the environment. Can
[Word Count: 13]

you keep up? Let’s face it — legacy SIEM solutions have failed the SOC. They are too slow,
[Word Count: 18]

complex and costly, and they were designed for an age when data volumes — and adversary
[Word Count: 16]

speed and sophistication — were a fraction of what they are today. You need a tool that’s
[Word Count: 17]

faster, easier to deploy and more cost-effective than legacy SIEM solutions. Investigate
[Word Count: 12]

better approaches, such as CrowdStrike Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM, which unifies all threat
[Word Count: 12]

detection, investigation and response in one cloud-delivered, AI-native platform for unrivaled
[Word Count: 11]

efficiency and speed. Or, if you don’t have an internal SOC team, consider 24/7 managed
[Word Count: 15]

Though technology is clearly critical in the fight to detect and stop intrusions, the end
[Word Count: 15]

user remains a crucial link in the chain to stop breaches. User awareness programs should
[Word Count: 15]

be initiated to combat the continued threat of phishing and related social engineering
[Word Count: 13]

techniques. For security teams, practice makes perfect. Encourage an environment that
[Word Count: 11]

routinely performs tabletop exercises and red/blue teaming to identify gaps and eliminate
[Word Count: 12]

weaknesses in your cybersecurity practices and response.
