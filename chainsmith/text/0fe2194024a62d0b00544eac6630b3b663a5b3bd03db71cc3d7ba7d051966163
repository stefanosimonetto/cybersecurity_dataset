PowWeb cleans up the iframe infection

Last May, you might recall I had a problem with my website over at PoWWeb. It seems that somehow an iframe had been appended to the bottom of my site so that if you went to my page, it also called http://www.tgp.la/or.html and attempted to install spyware. I wrote about that here. This came up again last week.
The staff at PowWeb posted that they have cleaned up the infection by removing the malicious code. I know they really didn’t want have to touch people’s webpages, but I think this was the best solution. I hope they’ve taken some steps to prevent this from happening again.
