VanMorrison.com Iframe

Posted by Roger on 21 October 2009, 3:55 pm

Saw a virus alert today. A user performed an AOL Search (that alone should be banned in our end user behavior policy) on “van morrison” (another termination offense). He/She clicked on a link for www.vanmorrison.com. The antivirus detected an iframe attack.
Manually looking at www.vanmorrison.com’s source, I currently see a iframe loading ‘http://iqsp.ru:8080/index.php’. Perhaps someone can remind me, aren’t there sites like virus total where you can send them a link and they’ll tell you what’s up. I haven’t yet learned javascript deobfuscation but that didn’t look like good stuff was happening.
So I took a sacrificial lamb system. (still dangerous don’t try this at home). And went to www.vanmorrison.com using various security systems to see what the result was.
Bluecoat – detected the virus on the site. Blocked Access to the entire site.
Scansafe – detected the virus on the site. blocked access to the entire site.
Purewire – site loaded. Wanted me to install Flash (seemed legit but I didn’t do it). Java started up. I was prompted to download a file and run a ActiveX control. I chose not to install the ActiveX control but I did download the file. It was a pdf file.
Virus total saw the pdf file first on October 16th (today is the 21st). Currently 13 out of 41 venders are detecting this as a virus. Did I mention signature detection is dead dead dead.
Did you notice the link to the Russian site is on port 8080? I wonder how many HTTP security implementation are proxying 8080 traffic in addition to 80.

I see Sophos and eweek have linked to this article. Thanks!
Pob is correct, the infection changed after I posted this entry. I went back yesterday to see if anyone cleaned it. I found the site on Google’s naughty list and the site had obfuscated code like he screenshots. Didn’t check on it today.
