iPhone 6 Scam Returns
We’re seeing what appears to be a familiar scam on the verge of a comeback.

As you can see, we first encountered the spammed link on LinkedIn, thanks to a user named Kolko Kolko, who according to his profile is a coach and has the face of an A-list celebrity.
Doing a quick online search using the Goog.gl shortened URL brings up other domains—Google Plus, Livejournal, and Picasa, specifically—where the list is also being posted and shared.
