End and corporate users (and especially Pizza eaters), beware!
Cybercriminals are currently spamvertising hundreds of thousands of emails, impersonating FLORENTINO`s Pizzeria, and enticing  users into clicking on a client-side exploits and malware serving link in order to cancel a $169.90 order that they never really made.

More details:

Once the user clicks on the link, they will be redirected to a compromised site serving client-side exploits and ultimately dropping multiple malicious binaries on their hosts upon a successful infection.
Malicious URL: hxxp://oldsoccer.it/page1.htm?RANDOM_STRINGS
Client-side exploits used: CVE-2010-0188 and CVE-2012-0507
The malicious URL contains a tiny iFrame pointing to the fast-fluxed domain uiwewsecondary.ru:8080/internet/fpkrerflfvd.php where the client-side exploitation takes place.
The redirection chain is as  follows:
uiwewsecondary.ru:8080/internet/fpkrerflfvd.php -> uiwewsecondary.ru:8080/internet/itbzewhqgrkv.jar -> uiwewsecondary.ru:8080/internet/xrcnenbmdpfzfpx.jar ->uiwewsecondary.ru:8080/internet/kqbzaubpiqxnbn.pdf -> poluicenotgo.ru:8080/internet/at.php?i=8

The Russian domains are fast-fluxed by the cybercriminals in an attempt to make it harder for security researchers and vendors to take down their campaign. We’ve seen a similar fast-flux technique applied in the following  campaign – “Spamvertised ‘Your tax return appeal is declined’ emails serving client-side exploits and malware“.
Upon successful exploitation the campaign drops the following MD5 on the infected hosts: MD5: 03d874abaaca02b090372eee2d090dc0 detected as Trojan.Generic.KDV.602078; Troj/Agent-VSS.
What happens once the dropped MD5 executes? Basically, it phones back to the following domains/URLs:

dare2dreamz.com/pony/gate.php
cityweddingguide.com
dynolite.eu
abbott.u4ria.co.za
demircioglubilgisayar.com.tr

It also downloads more malicious binaries from the following compromised URLs:

dynolite.eu/7U0ASvP9/AZz.exe
abbott.u4ria.co.za/HGFg1RHz/MkiZMX.exe
demircioglubilgisayar.com.tr/qy3kMMxv/VgWqQm4k.exe

All the binaries are identical, and have the following MD5, MD5: 97d8f1fa11c86befa069845ffaf818db currently detected as TrojWare.Win32.Kryptik.ADXK by 7 out of 42 antivirus scanners.
Webroot SecureAnywhere customers are proactively protected from this threat.
