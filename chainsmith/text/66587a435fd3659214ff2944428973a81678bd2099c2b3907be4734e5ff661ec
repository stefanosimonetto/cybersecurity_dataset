Yesterday I took control of a system running FreeBSD 5.4.  I wanted to upgrade it to FreeBSD 6.0.  I considered using cvsup to upgrade the userland and kernel, but I wanted an easier way.  I also wanted to end up with a completely GENERIC system that would work well with freebsd-update.I decided to follow Colin Percival's FreeBSD 5.4 to FreeBSD 6.0 binary upgrade instructions.  This process worked flawlessly.  I am not going to repeat the steps here, but I will point out a few details.In step 2 of his process, Colin uses freebsd-update to create a base-modified file.  Mine had these contents:# cat base-modified/.cshrc/boot/defaults/loader.conf/boot/kernel/kernel/boot/kernel/linker.hints/etc/group/etc/hosts/etc/manpath.config/etc/master.passwd/etc/motd/etc/passwd/etc/pwd.db/etc/shells/etc/spwd.db/etc/ttys/root/.cshrc/usr/share/man/cat1/crontab.1.gz/usr/share/man/cat1/tcpdump.1.gz/usr/share/man/cat1/uname.1.gz/usr/share/man/cat8/ifconfig.8.gz/usr/share/man/whatis/var/db/locate.database/var/log/auth.log/var/log/cron/var/log/debug.log/var/log/lastlog/var/log/maillog/var/log/sendmail.st/var/log/wtmp/var/run/utmpThe first three files are associated with this system running a modified 5.4 kernel.  I did not want to preserve those changes.  I wanted to preserve all of the changes to files in /etc/, as those are important -- password files and the like.  I did not care about changes to files in /usr.  I preserved files in /var that related to logs.  I decided to make a new version with these contents.# cat base-modified.final /.cshrc/etc/group/etc/hosts/etc/manpath.config/etc/master.passwd/etc/motd/etc/passwd/etc/pwd.db/etc/shells/etc/spwd.db/etc/ttys/root/.cshrc/var/log/auth.log/var/log/cron/var/log/debug.log/var/log/lastlog/var/log/maillog/var/log/sendmail.st/var/log/wtmp/var/run/utmpIn step 14, Colin recommends recompiling all installed ports.  I decided to simply pkg_delete all of them.  I will add back new packages when the upgrade process is finished.After following Colin's directions, I ended up with a system running FreeBSD 6.0 RELEASE.  I was able to use freebsd-update to apply binary updates of the kernel and userland.  I did all of this remotely over OpenSSH.  Very cool -- thanks Colin!
