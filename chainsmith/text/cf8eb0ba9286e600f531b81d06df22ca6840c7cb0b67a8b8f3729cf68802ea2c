Cybercriminals have recently launched yet another massive spam campaign, impersonating a rather popular brand used in a decent percentage of social engineering driven email campaigns – the BBB (Better Business Bureau).
Once users click on any of the links in the malicious emails, they’re automatically exposed to the client-side exploits served by the Black Hole Exploit kit.

We’ve already seen the same name servers used in the previously profiled “Fake ‘Citi Account Alert’ themed emails lead to Black Hole Exploit Kit“; “Spamvertised ‘Your Recent eBill from Verizon Wireless’ themed emails serve client-side exploits and malware” campaigns.
Upon successful client-side exploitation, the campaign drops MD5: 2646f13db754654aff315ff9da9fa911 – detected by 30 out of 46 antivirus scanners as Worm:Win32/Cridex.E.
Upon execution, the sample phones back to:
94.73.129.120:8080/rxrt0CA/hIvhA/K66fEB/
Webroot SecureAnywhere users are proactively protected from these threats.
