A week in security (July 31 – August 6)
Last week we explored some basic PowerShell commands, dived into the new methods used by TrickBot, and wrote at length about the Magnitude exploit kit redirection chain. Our teams were busy at both BlackHat and DefCon, and outside of those famous hallways, we also took time to fire up some basic PowerShell programs.
Naturally the two big security events have consumed most of the column inches this past week, but even so there’s still a couple of notable security stories floating around.
