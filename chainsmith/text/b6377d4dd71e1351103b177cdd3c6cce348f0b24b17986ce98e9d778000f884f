We’ve intercepted an ongoing malicious campaign, relying on injected/embedded iFrames at Web sites acting as intermediaries for a successful client-side exploits to take place. Let’s dissect the campaign, expose the malicious domains portfolio/infrastructure it relies on, as well as directly connect it with historical malicious activity, in this particular case, a social engineering campaign pushing fake browser updates.

Sample screenshot of the script identifying the client’s Flash Player version:

iFrame URL: mexstat210.ru – 88.198.7.48
Known to have responsed to the same IP (88.198.7.48) are also the following malicious domains:

The following malicious MD5s are also known to have been hosted on the same IP (88.198.7.48):

Domain name reconnaissance: chinesenewyeartrendy.biz – 46.105.166.96 known to have responded to the same IP is also appearancemanager.biz
Detection rates for the dropped PDF exploits:
MD5: 77cd239509c0c5ca6f52c38a23b505f3 – detected by 3 out of 48 antivirus scanners as Heuristic.BehavesLike.PDF.Exploit-CRT.F; HEUR_PDFJS.STREM

Both malicious PDF files exploit CVE-2010-0188 which also phone back to : urkqpv.chinesenewyeartrendy.biz:39031/f/1381405800/1381405863/ce504b9214abf8db6ce3d7276b7badbb/7770e5aab4389e4e2faf75514bed926e/6
It gets even more interesting, taking into consideration the fact that the iFrame injected/embedded URL includes a secondary iFrame pointing to a, surprise, surprise, Traffic Exchange network. Not surprisingly, we also identified a related threat that is currently using the same infrastructure as the official Web site of the Traffic Exchange.

Secondary iFrame: mxdistant.com – 213.239.231.141
Known to have responded to the same IP in the past are also the following malicious domains:
photosgram.com
worldtraff.ru
worldtraffic.biz
Which inevitably leads us to photosgram.com/gallery.exe – MD5: 961dba6cf73d24181634321e90323577 – detected by 13 out of 48 antivirus scanners as TROJ_GEN.R0CBOH0I713; Artemis!961DBA6CF73D.
Once executed, it phones back to anyplace-gateway.info – 76.72.165.63 – info@remote-control-pc.com
The following MD5s are also known to have phoned back to the same IP in the past:
MD5: c4fb386b785e8c337e378d2c318c18c7
