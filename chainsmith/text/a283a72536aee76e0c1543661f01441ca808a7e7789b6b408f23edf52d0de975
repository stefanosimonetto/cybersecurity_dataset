Testing Flash Versions

Posted by Roger on 10 July 2006, 12:00 am

As I patch Flash on a variety of computers, an event that seems to be more and more common, sometimes I want to doublecheck that I’ve been successful. Looking for flash9.ocx in %windir%\system32\macromed\flash is one way, but who knows for sure if that is accurate. Looking at the version of getflash.exe in the same directory is also useful, but again, flash is doing some weird stuff, and I still see flash.ocx, flash8.ocx and flash8b.ocx in that directory.
I found one way to get some assurance. Flash has a website at http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_15507 to identify what version of flash is being run on your computer. The latest version of Flash at the time of this post is 9.0.16.0. When you go there, make sure to verify each browser on your computer.
If you’re having a hard time upgrading to 9 make sure you close all browser windows after installing the newer version of flash. Otherwise the current version of flash will not exit. If that fails, perhaps using the uninstaller for 8 first will help.
I do worry about the leftover flash8.ocx and flash8b.ocx files. What if its like SUN JAVA and and previous vulnerable version is still around and can be requested by an attacker? Should I be deleting the earlier versions from my computer as a standard practice?
