The Roblox Robux generator is too good to be true
Roblox is an enormously popular MMORPG title for kids available on both PC and console, and it suffers no end of scammers trying to fleece its players as a result. While the game tries to block and filter text/URLs and comes with additional security features, potentially dubious sites also bounce around outside of the Roblox environment. Here’s one we had sent our way, located at:
robloxrobux(dot)gamehack(dot)co

The site claims to walk that well-worn path of free coin/item/whatever generation, in return for entering your username and a few other values such as desired coin (“Robux”) amount. There’s also a chat box in the bottom right corner which repeats the same text every time you visit the page, mostly to the tune of “Yes, this definitely worked 100% for me, honest”. Once all info is submitted and the magic “Do things now” button is pressed, it delivers the well-worn trick of popping a fake box claiming things are happening behind the scenes. Secret, hacker-style things working their magic on Roblox servers.

Unfortunately for the person using it, it’s all complete nonsense and leads gamers to the usual assortment of survey links.
We don’t have much to add here besides “Don’t bother”. All you’ll get for your troubles is your personal information added to marketing databases via the survey links. If you have young relatives playing Roblox, please consider informing them about sites such as the above.
