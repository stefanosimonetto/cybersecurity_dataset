Blog Comments – Analysing 100,000 Comments and Spammers

“Nice blog, thanks for the info”
“Awesome site. Great job”
“You should take part in a contest for one of the best blogs on the web. I will recommend this site!”

I know you like flattering comments on your website. And I know you love to see many comments on each one of your posts (say you community participation). Who doesn’t, right? We love them too.
So we decided to take a closer look at the last 100,000 (well, 98,238 to be more exact) comments that were sent to the network of sites that we are monitoring. How much of them are spam? Who are the most annoying spammers? And things like that.

Comment Analysis
We filtered the latest 98,238 comments received (that’s less than a week worth of comments), and ran them through our analysis engine. Guess how many of them were spam? How many were good?

Spam comments: 79,858 (81.2%)
Good comments: 18,380 (18.8%)

Wow! So according to our analysis, more than 80% of the comments were classified as spam. We even took a conservative approach and classified unsure comments as good comments. So out of every 5 comments received, only 1 was valid.
*Unsure comments were ones we only saw hitting one web site, but the content was suspicious. Those in this list were almost 10,000 (9% of the overall total). If we had classified those as spam, the number would have grown to 90+% spam.
Spam Analysis – Messages
This really amused us. What type of message do you think a spammer was sending? Most of the time, we noticed that they sent a flattering note to increase the odds of the webmaster accepting the comment. Here are the top 10 messages sent by spammers:

238 sites, comment => Thank you very much!

213 sites, comment => awesome site. Great job

191 sites, comment => Nice blog, thanks for the info.

186 sites, comment => Your website is really good!

172 sites, comment => Webmaster, I am the admin at SEOPlugins.org.  We
profile SEO Plugins for WordPress blogs for on-site and off-site SEO.  I'd like to invite you to check out our recent profile for a pretty amazing plugin which can double or triple traffic for a Worpdress blog and we just posted  a video showing the plugin in action.  You can delete this comment, I didn't want to comment on your blog, just wanted to drop you a personal message.  Thanks,  Rich

144 sites, comment => Yup, you know it-, just like I've been saying.

137 sites,  comment => Louis Vuitton Shoes Ankle Boot

123 sites,  comment => Buy Viagra Online

108 sites, comment => You made some decent points there. I looked on the internet for the issue and found most individuals will go along with with your website.

106 sites, comment => You should take part in a contest for one of the best blogs on the web. I will recommend this site!
The last one in the list is the funniest (“You should take part in a contest for one of the best blogs on the web. I will recommend this site”). Taking out the Viagra and the Louis Vuitton spam, why do they do it?
They do it because in the URL field, they add a link to their own web site (which can increase their page rankings, visitors, etc). Example:

[author] => Mary Jane
[email] => info@fabfunapps.com
[url] => http://fabfunapps.com
[comment] => Good share! I hope more people will discover your blog because you really know what you’re talking about. Can’t wait to read more from you

Spam Analysis – Emails

Spam Analysis – Countries
Out of curiosity we decided to check the top Countries sending spam (based on the IP address):

23,899 United States (31%)
16,888 China (22%)
5,145 Russian Federation (6.7%)
3,291 Brazil (4.3%)

In the olympics of SPAM, the USA is #1, followed by China (Silver), Russia (Bronze) and Brazil.
Conclusion
Yes, there is a lot of spam out there. I would say that 9 out of 10 comments are spammy in some way (even if not automated – we only classified automated messages as spam). In any event, let us know if you want any more information from this list. We have raw data, so we can run numbers and different analysis as requested.
