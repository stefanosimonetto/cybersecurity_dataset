Updated appid_calc.pl
January 8, 2016 in appid_calc.pl, Forensic Analysis, Software Releases

I was recently contacted by Terry O. who spotted and reported a bug in appid_calc.pl which I released back in 2013. After analysis I realized that I made a stupid mistake in the way the parameters were passed to the functions responsible for APPID calculation. Oops.
I have updated the script yesterday and hopefully it should work now ðŸ™‚
You can download its latest version here.
Thanks to Terry for providing the feedback. This is much appreciated.
