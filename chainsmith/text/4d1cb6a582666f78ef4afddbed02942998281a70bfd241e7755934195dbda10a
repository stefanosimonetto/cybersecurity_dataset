Broadband Reports has a link to a list of dubious spyware products.

Some anti-spyware products actually install spyware.
Some anti-spyware products are really just bad copies of established software like adaware and spybot search and destroy.
and Some just dont work very well.
So how do you tell the difference? Its best to stay with the established leaders like spybot and adaware, but sometimes they dont offer the features we need. This list is a great resource for what to watch out for.
