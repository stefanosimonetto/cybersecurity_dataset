Cybercriminals are currently spamvertising millions of emails impersonating United Parcel Service (UPS) in an attempt to trick end and corporate users into clicking on exploits and malware serving links found in the malicious emails. What exploits are they using? How widespread is the campaign? Is it an isolated incident, or is the campaign linked to more malicious activity?
More details:

Screenshots of the spamvertised campaign:

Upon clicking on the link, users are exposed to the following bogus page displaying additional information about the package:

This is the second UPS themed campaign that we’ve intercepted during June, 2012. In the first campaign, the cybercriminals used malicious .html attachments compared to directly linking to exploits and malware serving sites like we’ve seen in the latest campaign.
