Cybercriminals are currently spamvertising millions of emails impersonating Discover, in an attempt to trick cardholders into clicking on the client-side exploits serving URLs found in the malicious emails. Upon clicking on the links, users are exposed to the client-side exploits served by the latest version of the Black Hole Exploit Kit.

Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

Sample compromised URLs used in the campaign: hxxp://www.alacinc.org.nz/impdiscm.html; hxxp://viajesybuceo.es/impdiscm.html; hxxp://www.akncorporation.com/impdiscm.html; hxxp://www.smoc.tw/impdiscm.html; hxxp://www.mofty.net/impdiscm.html; hxxp://akweb.nl/webcalendar/includes/impdiscm.html; hxxp://fullhome.net/discinfo.html
Client-side exploits serving URLs: hxxp://netgear-india.net/detects/discover-important_message.php; hxxp://netgear-india.net/detects/discover-important_message.php?qejbu=360a070b03&tfy=35&xio=34023705350a050a0b38&wcxa=02000200020002; hxxp://teamscapabilitieswhich.org/detects/discover-important_message.php
Upon loading, these URLs attempt to exploit CVE-2010-0188 by dropping a malicious PDF file on the affected host, which then drops the actual malware upon successful client-side exploitation.
Sample detection rate for the dropped malware: MD5: 80601551f1c83ee326b3094e468c6b42 – detected by 4 out of 44 antivirus scanners as UDS:DangerousObject.Multi.Generic
Upon execution, the sample phones back to 200.169.13.84:8080/AJtw/UCyqrDAA/Ud+asDAA, AS21574
