The Stuxnet analysis “Stuxnet under the Microscope” we published a few weeks ago has been updated…

The Stuxnet analysis “Stuxnet under the Microscope” we published a few weeks ago has been updated, as promised, to include some information about the recently-patched win32k.sys vulnerability (MS10-073, or CVE-2010-2743), and just a little about the Task Scheduler issue that hasn’t been patched yet.

Randy Abrams has filled a hole in Babelfish’s functionality by blogging his translation from the classical Geek of the paper to what passes for English in the US. ;-) Well, it’s all Geek to me. [Insert your own favourite Trojan pun here.]

I’m afraid the paper now runs to a hefty 72 pages…
