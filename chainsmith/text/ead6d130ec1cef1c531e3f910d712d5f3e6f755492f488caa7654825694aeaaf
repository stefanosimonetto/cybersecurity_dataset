Yet another case of malvertising on The Pirate Bay
The Pirate Bay is famous for its tumultuous relationship with copyright advocates and law enforcement. And yet, despite police raids and numerous trials, the torrent site is still going strong with a new infrastructure, as detailed in a recent article published by Torrent Freak.
From a security standpoint, The Pirate Bay has been involved in notorious malvertising attacks, most likely resulting in a large number of infections given the site’s high traffic.
BlueCoat and Malekal blogged about this before and what we caught in our honeypots today is not in fact all that different.
General overview
This malvertising case involves adexprt.com and exoclick.com at the source, while the final redirection is orchestrated by seethisinaction.com and valu-traffic.com:

Exploit kit

We encounter the Angler exploit kit in its ‘classic’ thread (as opposed to the fileless one). Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit detects and blocks the Adobe Flash exploit:

Payload
The binary dropped is detected as Trojan.Ransom.ED by Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.
At the end of the day, we are not too surprised about this malvertising attack. A site that (over)uses advertisements (and especially salacious ones) is navigating dangerous waters.
The problem with The Pirate Bay is that it generates a lot of traffic which means a lot of potential infections, something traffers (bad guys who resell traffic) and exploit kit operators salivate about.
As always, keeping your computer up to date and using additional exploit protection will prevent these nasty drive-by downloads. Additionally, you should be careful which torrent files you are downloading, as they often contain malware.
