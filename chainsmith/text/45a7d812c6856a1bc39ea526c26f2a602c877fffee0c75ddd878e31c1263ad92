DotA 2 Phishing Page Offers Up Treasure Keys and Rare Items
Fans of DotA 2, the most popular game on the Steam platform with up to 700,000 concurrent players, should be wary of the following URL:
steamonlinereward(dot)webs(dot)com
Reported on the Steam forums a few days ago in a number of threads, this site claims to offer up a “Steam Online Reward” in the form of keys and Arcana (rare item drops).

Curiously, they also want your Yahoo login along with your username and password. Should you enter your details, a screen will state that they’ll be getting back to you.

I think there’s more chance of me remembering what DotA actually stands for than anybody being sent some freebie items (Dawn Defense of the Ancients, which I’m sure I’ll forget again in about 10 minutes time.)
Edit: As you can see from the strikethrough, it wasn’t even 10 minutes.
With so many users, DotA is rich pickings for anybody wanting to do some account harvesting. If scammers don’t want your account, they’ll almost certainly want to try and scam some valuable in-game items via the trading screen instead.
Brush up on some Steam account security tips and always think twice before jumping on the tempting offer of the week bandwagon.
More often than not, the wheels are bound to come off…
