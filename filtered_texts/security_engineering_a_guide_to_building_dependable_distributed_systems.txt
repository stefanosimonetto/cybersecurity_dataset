The purpose of this book is to give a solid introduction to security engineer-
ing, as we understand it at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. My goal
is that it works at four different levels:
[Word Count: 36]

1. As a textbook that you can read from one end to the other over a few days as an
introduction to the subject. The book is to be used mainly by the working
IT professional who needs to learn about the subject, but it can also be
used in a one-semester course in a university.
[Word Count: 56]

2. As a reference book to which you can come for an overview of the workings of
some particular type of system. These systems include cash machines, taxi
meters, radar jammers, anonymous medical record databases, and so on.
[Word Count: 38]

3. As an introduction to the underlying technologies, such as crypto, access con-
trol, inference control, tamper resistance, and seals. Space prevents me from
going into great depth; but I provide a basic road map for each subject,
plus a reading list for the curious (and a list of open research problems
for the prospective graduate student).
[Word Count: 57]

programmer or engineer who is trying to design real systems that will keep on
working despite the best efforts of customers, managers, and everybody else.
This book is divided into three parts.
[Word Count: 32]

The ﬁrst looks at basic concepts, starting with the central concept of a
security protocol, and going on to human-computer interface issues,
access controls, cryptology, and distributed system issues. It does not
assume any particular technical background other than basic computer
literacy. It is based on an Introduction to Security course that I teach to
second-year undergraduates.
[Word Count: 57]

The second part looks in much more detail at a number of important
applications, such as military communications, medical record systems,
cash machines, mobile phones, and pay-TV. These are used to intro-
duce more of the advanced technologies and concepts. It also considers
information security from the viewpoint of a number of different inter-
est groups, such as companies, consumers, criminals, police, and spies.
This material is drawn from my senior course on security, from research
work, and from experience consulting.
[Word Count: 81]

The third part looks at the organizational and policy issues: how com-
puter security interacts with law, with evidence, and with corporate pol-
itics; how we can gain conﬁdence that a system will perform as intended;
and how the whole business of security engineering can best be
managed.
[Word Count: 48]

I believe that building systems that continue to perform robustly in the face
of malice is one of the most important, interesting, and difﬁcult tasks facing
engineers in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
[Word Count: 31]

of articles I wrote on security engineering (starting with ‘Why Cryptosystems
Fail’ in 1993); and the need to teach an undergraduate class in security led to
the development of a set of lecture notes that made up about half of this book.
Finally, in 1999, I got round to rewriting them for a general technical audience.
I have learned a lot in the process; writing down what you think you know
is a good way of ﬁnding out what you don’t. I have also had a lot of fun. I
hope you have as much fun reading it!
[Word Count: 98]

Further Acknowledgments for
the Second Edition
[Word Count: 6]

I cannot emphasize too strongly that the tricks taught in this book are intended
only to enable you to build better systems. They are not in any way given as
a means of helping you to break into systems, subvert copyright protection
mechanisms, or do anything else unethical or illegal.
Where possible I have tried to give case histories at a level of detail that
illustrates the underlying principles without giving a ‘hacker’s cookbook’.
[Word Count: 74]

It will not follow that everything must be suppresst which may be abused. . .
If all those useful inventions that are liable to abuse should therefore be
concealed there is not any Art or Science which may be lawfully profest.
[Word Count: 41]

The question was raised again in the nineteenth century, when some well-
meaning people wanted to ban books on locksmithing. A contemporary writer
on the subject replied [750]:
[Word Count: 28]

Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discussion respecting the
means for bafﬂing the supposed safety of locks offers a premium for
dishonesty, by showing others how to be dishonest. This is a fallacy.
Rogues are very keen in their profession, and already know much more
than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery. Rogues
knew a good deal about lockpicking long before locksmiths discussed
it among themselves . . . if there be harm, it will be much more than
counterbalanced by good.

speciﬁcally in Part III. For now, in order to set the scene, I’ll give a few brief
examples here of interesting security systems and what they are designed to
prevent.
[Word Count: 30]

Banks operate a surprisingly large range of security-critical computer systems.
[Word Count: 10]

2. One public face of the bank is its automatic teller machines. Authenticat-
ing transactions based on a customer’s card and personal identiﬁcation
number — in such a way as to defend against both outside and inside
attack — is harder than it looks! There have been many epidemics of
‘phantom withdrawals’ in various countries when local villains (or bank
staff) have found and exploited loopholes in the system. Automatic teller
machines are also interesting as they were the ﬁrst large scale commer-
cial use of cryptography, and they helped establish a number of crypto
standards.
[Word Count: 96]

4. Behind the scenes are a number of high-value messaging systems. These
are used to move large sums of money (whether between local banks
or between banks internationally); to trade in securities; to issue letters
of credit and guarantees; and so on. An attack on such a system is the
dream of the sophisticated white-collar criminal. The defense is a mix-
ture of bookkeeping procedures, access controls, and cryptography.
[Word Count: 69]

I’ll look at these applications in later chapters. Banking computer security is
important: until quite recently, banks were the main non-military market for
many computer security products, so they had a disproportionate inﬂuence
on security standards. Secondly, even where their technology isn’t blessed by
an international standard, it is often widely used in other sectors anyway.
[Word Count: 56]

Military systems have also been an important technology driver. They have
motivated much of the academic research that governments have funded into
computer security in the last 20 years. As with banking, there is not one single
application but many.
[Word Count: 40]

2. Military communication systems have some interesting requirements.
It is often not sufﬁcient to just encipher messages: the enemy, on see-
ing trafﬁc encrypted with somebody else’s keys, may simply locate the
transmitter and attack it. Low-probability-of-intercept (LPI) radio links are
one answer; they use a number of tricks that are now being adopted in
applications such as copyright marking. Covert communications are also
important in some privacy applications, such as in defeating the Internet
censorship imposed by repressive regimes.
[Word Count: 80]

4. The particular problems of protecting nuclear weapons have given rise
over the last two generations to a lot of interesting security technology,
ranging from electronic authentication systems that prevent weapons
being used without the permission of the national command author-
ity, through seals and alarm systems, to methods of identifying people
with a high degree of certainty using biometrics such as iris patterns.
[Word Count: 64]

The civilian security engineer can learn a lot from all this. For example, many
early systems for inserting copyright marks into digital audio and video, which
used ideas from spread-spectrum radio, were vulnerable to desynchronisation
attacks that are also a problem for some spread-spectrum systems. Another
example comes from munitions management. There, a typical system enforces
rules such as ‘Don’t put explosives and detonators in the same truck’. Such
[Word Count: 69]

techniques can be recycled in food logistics — where hygiene rules forbid raw
and cooked meats being handled together.
[Word Count: 19]

From soldiers and food hygiene we move on to healthcare. Hospitals have a
number of interesting protection requirements — mostly to do with patient
safety and privacy.
[Word Count: 27]

2. Patient records are often anonymized for use in research, but this is
hard to do well. Simply encrypting patient names is usually not enough
as an enquiry such as ‘show me all records of 59 year old males who

usually be enough to ﬁnd the record of a politician who was known
to have sustained such an injury at college. But if records cannot be
anonymized properly, then much stricter rules have to be followed
when handling the data, and this increases the cost of medical research.

3. Web-based technologies present interesting new assurance problems
in healthcare. For example, as reference books — such as directories
of drugs — move online, doctors need assurance that life-critical data,
such as the ﬁgures for dosage per body weight, are exactly as published
by the relevant authority, and have not been mangled in some way.
Another example is that as doctors start to access patients’ records from
home or from laptops or even PDAs during house calls, suitable elec-
tronic authentication and encryption tools are starting to be required.
[Word Count: 89]

4. New technology can introduce risks that are just not understood. Hos-
pital administrators understand the need for backup procedures to deal
with outages of power, telephone service and so on; but medical prac-
tice is rapidly coming to depend on the net in ways that are often not
documented. For example, hospitals in Britain are starting to use online
radiology systems: X-rays no longer travel from the X-ray machine to the

operating theatre in an envelope, but via a server in a distant town. So a
network failure can stop doctors operating just as much as a power fail-
ure. All of a sudden, the Internet turns into a safety-critical system, and
denial-of-service attacks might kill people.
[Word Count: 46]

We will look at medical system security too in more detail later. This is a
much younger ﬁeld than banking IT or military systems, but as healthcare
accounts for a larger proportion of GNP than either of them in all developed
countries, and as hospitals are adopting IT at an increasing rate, it looks set to
become important. In the USA in particular, the HIPAA legislation — which
sets minimum standards for privacy — has made the sector a major client of
the information security industry.
[Word Count: 86]

You might not think that the typical family operates any secure systems. But
consider the following.
[Word Count: 16]

1. Many families use some of the systems we’ve already described. You
may use a web-based electronic banking system to pay bills, and in a few
years you may have encrypted online access to your medical records.
Your burglar alarm may send an encrypted ‘all’s well’ signal to the secu-
rity company every few minutes, rather than waking up the neighbor-
hood when something happens.
[Word Count: 65]

2. Your car probably has an electronic immobilizer that sends an encrypted
challenge to a radio transponder in the key fob; the transponder has to
respond correctly before the car will start. This makes theft harder and
cuts your insurance premiums. But it also increases the number of car
thefts from homes, where the house is burgled to get the car keys. The
really hard edge is a surge in car-jackings: criminals who want a getaway
car may just take one at gunpoint.
[Word Count: 83]

3. Early mobile phones were easy for villains to ‘clone’: users could
suddenly ﬁnd their bills inﬂated by hundreds or even thousands of
dollars. The current GSM digital mobile phones authenticate them-
selves to the network by a cryptographic challenge-response protocol
similar to the ones used in car door locks and immobilizers.
[Word Count: 52]

4. Satellite TV set-top boxes decipher movies so long as you keep paying
your subscription. DVD players use copy control mechanisms based on
cryptography and copyright marking to make it harder to copy disks (or
to play them outside a certain geographic area). Authentication proto-
cols can now also be used to set up secure communications on home net-
works (including WiFi, Bluetooth and HomePlug).
[Word Count: 65]

5. In many countries, households who can’t get credit can get prepayment
meters for electricity and gas, which they top up using a smartcard or
other electronic key which they reﬁll at a local store. Many universi-
ties use similar technologies to get students to pay for photocopier use,
washing machines and even soft drinks.

Many of the terms used in security engineering are straightforward, but some
are misleading or even controversial. There are more detailed deﬁnitions of
technical terms in the relevant chapters, which you can ﬁnd using the index.
In this section, I’ll try to point out where the main problems lie.
The ﬁrst thing we need to clarify is what we mean by system. In practice,
this can denote:
[Word Count: 67]

1. a product or component, such as a cryptographic protocol, a smartcard
or the hardware of a PC;
[Word Count: 18]

2. a collection of the above plus an operating system, communications and
other things that go to make up an organization’s infrastructure;
[Word Count: 22]

3. the above plus one or more applications (media player, browser, word
processor, accounts / payroll package, and so on);

5. any or all of the above plus internal users and management;

6. any or all of the above plus customers and other external users.
[Word Count: 13]

1That some persons are not people may seem slightly confusing but it’s well established: blame
the lawyers.
[Word Count: 17]

Secrecy is a technical term which refers to the effect of the mechanisms
used to limit the number of principals who can access information, such
as cryptography or computer access controls.
[Word Count: 31]

Conﬁdentiality involves an obligation to protect some other person’s or
organization’s secrets if you know them.
[Word Count: 16]

Privacy is the ability and/or right to protect your personal information
and extends to the ability and/or right to prevent invasions of your

personal space (the exact deﬁnition of which varies quite sharply from
one country to another). Privacy can extend to families but not to legal
persons such as corporations.
[Word Count: 28]

‘‘When I use a word,’’ Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, ‘‘it
means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.’’ ‘‘The question is,’’
said Alice, ‘‘whether you can make words mean so many different things.’’ ‘‘The
question is,’’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘‘which is to be master — that’s all.’’
[Word Count: 56]

The security engineer should develop sensitivity to the different nuances of
meaning that common words acquire in different applications, and to be able to
formalize what the security policy and target actually are. That may sometimes
be inconvenient for clients who wish to get away with something, but, in gen-
eral, robust security design requires that the protection goals are made explicit.
[Word Count: 62]

Humans are incapable of securely storing high-quality
cryptographic keys, and they have unacceptable speed and accuracy
when performing cryptographic operations. (They are also large,
expensive to maintain, difﬁcult to manage, and they pollute the
environment. It is astonishing that these devices continue to be
manufactured and deployed. But they are sufﬁciently pervasive that
we must design our protocols around their limitations.)
[Word Count: 61]

Only amateurs attack machines; professionals target people.
[Word Count: 7]

Hacking systems through the people who operate them may be growing
rapidly but is not new. Military and intelligence organisations have always
targeted each other’s staff; most of the intelligence successes of the old Soviet
Union were of this kind [77]. Private investigation agencies have not been far
behind. The classic attack of this type is pretexting.

What the Brain Does Worse Than the Computer

Actions performed often become a matter of skill, but this comes with
a downside: inattention can cause a practised action to be performed
instead of an intended one. We are all familiar with such capture errors;
an example is when you intend to go to the supermarket on the way
[Word Count: 50]

Actions that people take by following rules are open to errors when they
follow the wrong rule. Various circumstances — such as information
overload — can cause people to follow the strongest rule they know, or
the most general rule, rather than the best one. Examples of phishermen
getting people to follow the wrong rule include using https (because
‘it’s secure’) and starting URLs with the impersonated bank’s name,
as www.citibank.secureauthentication.com — looking for the name
being for many people a stronger rule than parsing its position.

The third category of mistakes are those made by people for cognitive

as behavioural economics or decision science, sits at the boundary of psychology
and economics. It examines the ways in which people’s decision processes

2. Will the user remember the password, or will they have to either write it
down or choose one that’s easy for the attacker to guess?

Difﬁculties with Reliable Password Entry
[Word Count: 6]

2.4.2
Difﬁculties with Remembering the Password
[Word Count: 6]

sites typically contain numbers as well as letters, while the average password
length has gone up from six to eight characters and the most common pass-
word is not ‘password’ but ‘password1’ [1130]. One possible explanation is that
many people try to use the same password everywhere, and the deployment
of password checking programs on some websites trains them to use longer
passwords with numbers as well as letters [302].
[Word Count: 70]

The red (control) group was given the usual advice (password at least six
characters long, including one nonletter).
[Word Count: 18]

The green group was told to think of a passphrase and select letters from
it to build a password. So ‘It’s 12 noon and I am hungry’ would give
‘I’S12&IAH’.
[Word Count: 30]

The yellow group was told to select eight characters (alpha or numeric)
at random from a table we gave them, write them down, and destroy
this note after a week or two once they’d memorized the password.
[Word Count: 37]

For users who follow instructions, passwords based on mnemonic
phrases offer the best of both worlds. They are as easy to remember as
naively selected passwords, and as hard to guess as random passwords.
[Word Count: 34]

The problem then becomes one of user compliance. A signiﬁcant number
of users (perhaps a third of them) just don’t do what they’re told.
[Word Count: 24]

So the best compromise will often be a password checking program that
rejects ‘clearly bad’ user choices, plus a training program to get your compliant
users to choose mnemonic passwords. Password checking can be done using a
program like crack to ﬁlter user choices; other programs understand language
statistics and reject passwords that are too likely to be chosen by others at
random [353, 163]; another option is to mix the two ideas using a suitable
coding scheme [1207].

to conceal their PIN in the following way. Suppose your PIN is 2256. Choose
a four-letter word, say ‘blue’. Write these four letters down in the second,
second, ﬁfth and sixth columns of the card respectively, as shown in Figure 2.1.
Then ﬁll up the empty boxes with random letters.
[Word Count: 50]

Figure 2.1: A bad mnemonic system for bank PINs
[Word Count: 9]

This is clearly a bad idea. Even if the random letters aren’t written in
a slightly different way, a quick check shows that a four by ten matrix of
random letters may yield about two dozen words (unless there’s an ‘s’ on
the bottom row, when you can get 40–50). So the odds that the thief can
guess the PIN, given three attempts, have just shortened from 1 in 3000-odd
to 1 in 8.

A number of people have designed browser plug-ins that take the user-entered
password and transparently turn it into a strong, domain-speciﬁc password.
A typical mechanism is to hash it using a secret key and the domain name of
the web site into which it’s being entered [1085]. Even if the user always uses
the same password (even if he uses ‘password’ as his password), each web
site he visits will be provided with a different and hard-to-guess password
that is unique to him. Thus if he mistakenly enters his Citibank password into

Using the Browser’s Password Database
[Word Count: 6]

Choosing random passwords and letting your browser cache remember them
can be a pragmatic way of operating. It gets much of the beneﬁt of a password
mangler, as the browser will only enter the password into a web page with the
right URL (IE) or the same hostname and ﬁeld name (Firefox). It suffers from
some of the same drawbacks (dealing with amazon.com versus amazon.co.uk,

only a very small number of people will have both platforms compromised
at the same time. However, if everyone starts using an iPhone, or doing VoIP
telephony over wireless access points, then the assumption of independence
breaks down.
Nonetheless, if I were working for a bank and looking for a front-end
authentication solution today, two-channel would be the ﬁrst thing I would
look at. I’d be cautious about high-value clients, because of possible attacks
on the phone company, but for normal electronic banking it seems to give the
most bang for the buck.

phishermen will go after your competitors instead. (I’ll discuss what makes

Targeted attack on one account: an intruder tries to guess a particular
user’s password. He might try to guess the PIN for Bill Gates’s bank
account, or a rival’s logon password at the ofﬁce, in order to do mischief
directly. When this involves sending emails, it is known as spear phishing.
[Word Count: 51]

Attempt to penetrate any account on a system: the intruder tries to get a
logon as any user of the system. This is the classic case of the phisherman
trying to get a password for any user of a target bank’s online service.

Service denial attack: the attacker may wish to prevent the legitimate
user from using the system. This might be targeted on a particular acc-
ount or system-wide.

This taxonomy helps us ask relevant questions when evaluating a password
system.
[Word Count: 12]

Next, to what extent does the system need to protect users from each other?
In some systems — such as mobile phone systems and cash machine sys-
tems — no-one should be able to use the service at someone else’s expense.
It is assumed that the attackers are already legitimate users of the system. So
systems are (or at least should be) carefully designed so that knowledge of
one user’s password will not allow another identiﬁable user’s account to be
compromised.

Password entry is often poorly protected.

well if the attacker has a botnet. But if an automated-guessing attack does

Every thing secret degenerates, even the administration of justice; nothing is safe

So we need to look systematically at security protocols and how they fail. As
they are widely deployed and often very badly designed, I will give a number
of examples from different applications.

1With garage doors it’s even worse. A common chip is the Princeton PT2262, which uses 12
tri-state pins to encode 312 or 531,441 address codes. However implementers often don’t read
the data sheet carefully enough to understand tri-state inputs and treat them as binary instead,
getting 212. Many of them only use eight inputs, as the other four are on the other side of the
chip. And as the chip has no retry-lockout logic, an attacker can cycle through the combinations
quickly and open your garage door after 27 attempts on average.

This is the standard protocol engineering notation, and can be a bit confusing

The in-car token sends its name T followed by the encrypted value of
T concatenated with N, where N stands for ‘number used once’, or nonce.
Everything within the braces is encrypted, and the encryption binds T and
N together as well as obscuring their values. The purpose of the nonce is

Further interesting problems arise with mutual authentication, that is, when
two principals have to identify each other. Suppose, for example, that a sim-

attacking friendly aircraft had to be deployed in a ﬁghter-bomber too. Now
suppose that the air force simply installed one of their air gunners’ challenge
units in each aircraft and connected it to the ﬁre-control radar. But now an
enemy bomber might reﬂect a challenge back at our ﬁghter, get a correct
response, and then reﬂect that back as its own response:

encrypted so only Bob can read it.

3. Alice then calls Bob and presents the second certiﬁcate as her introduction.
Each of them decrypts the appropriate certiﬁcate under the key they share
with Sam and thereby gets access to the new key. Alice can now use the
key to send encrypted messages to Bob, and to receive messages from him
in return.
[Word Count: 55]

Replay attacks are a known problem with authentication protocols, so in
order that both Bob and Alice can check that the certiﬁcates are fresh, Sam may
include a timestamp in each of them. If certiﬁcates never expire, there might
be serious problems dealing with users whose privileges have been revoked.
Using our protocol notation, we could describe this as

Many things can go wrong, and here is a famous historical example. Many
existing key distribution protocols are derived from the Needham-Schroeder
protocol, which appeared in 1978 [960]. It is somewhat similar to the above,
but uses nonces rather than timestamps. It runs as follows:

system. The Needham-Schroeder paper explicitly assumes that all principals
behave themselves, and that all attacks come from outsiders [960]. With these
assumptions, the protocol remains sound.

The BAN logic provides a formal method for reasoning about the beliefs
of principals in cryptographic protocols. Its underlying idea is that we will
believe that a message is authentic if it is encrypted with a relevant key and it
is also fresh (that is, generated during the current run of the protocol). Further
assumptions include that principals will only assert statements they believe
in, and that some principals are authorities for certain kinds of statement. This
is formalized using a notation which includes:
[Word Count: 84]

A |≡X A believes X, or, more accurately, that A is entitled to believe X;
[Word Count: 15]

A |∼X A once said X (without implying that this utterance was recent or not);
[Word Count: 15]

A |⇒X A has jurisdiction over X, in other words A is the authority on X and is
to be trusted on it;
[Word Count: 23]

A ◁X A sees X, that is, someone sent a message to A containing X in such a
way that he can read and repeat it;
[Word Count: 26]

♯X X is fresh, that is, contains a current timestamp or some information
showing that it was uttered by the relevant principal during the current
run of the protocol;
[Word Count: 29]

{X}K X encrypted under the key K, as in the rest of this chapter;
[Word Count: 14]

A ↔K B A and B share the key K, in other words it is an appropriate key for
them to use to communicate.
[Word Count: 24]

There are further symbols dealing, for example, with public key operations
and with passwords, that need not concern us here.
These symbols are manipulated using a set of postulates which include:
[Word Count: 31]

the message meaning rule states that if A sees a message encrypted under K,
and K is a good key for communicating with B, then he will believe that the
message was once said by B. (We assume that each principal can recognize
[Word Count: 43]

and ignore his or her own messages.) Formally, A |≡A ↔K B, A ◁{X}K
[Word Count: 14]

the nonce-veriﬁcation rule states that if a principal once said a message,
and the message is fresh, then that principal still believes it. Formally,
A |≡♯X, A |≡B |∼X
[Word Count: 29]

the jurisdiction rule states that if a principal believes something, and is an
authority on the matter, then he or she should be believed. Formally, we
[Word Count: 26]

In this notation, the statements on the top are the conditions, and the one on
the bottom is the result. There are a number of further rules to cover the more
mechanical aspects of manipulation; for example, if A sees a statement then
he sees its components provided he knows the necessary keys, and if part of a
formula is known to be fresh, then the whole formula must be.
[Word Count: 70]

Assuming that the key K is only available to principals who can be trusted to
execute the protocol faithfully, formal veriﬁcation is now straightforward. The
trick is to start from the desired result and work backwards. In this case, we
wish to prove that the retailer should trust the check, i.e., R |≡X (the syntax
of checks and cryptographic keys is similar for our purposes here; a check is
good if and only if it is genuine and the date on it is sufﬁciently recent).

Microsoft could have incorporated effective security measures as
standard, but good sense prevailed. Security systems have a nasty
habit of backﬁring and there is no doubt they would cause
enormous problems.
[Word Count: 31]

Access control is the traditional center of gravity of computer security. It is
where security engineering meets computer science. Its function is to control
which principals (persons, processes, machines, . . .) have access to which
resources in the system — which ﬁles they can read, which programs they can
execute, how they share data with other principals, and so on.
Access control works at a number of levels (Figure 4.1).
[Word Count: 71]

Figure 4.1: Access controls at different levels in a system
[Word Count: 10]

2. The applications may be written on top of middleware, such as a
database management system or bookkeeping package, which enforces
a number of protection properties. For example, bookkeeping soft-
ware may ensure that a transaction which debits one ledger for a
certain amount must credit another ledger for the same amount, while
database software typically has access controls specifying which dictio-
naries a given user can select, and which procedures they can run.
[Word Count: 74]

3. The middleware will use facilities provided by the underlying operating
system. As this constructs resources such as ﬁles and communications
ports from lower level components, it acquires the responsibility for pro-
viding ways to control access to them.
[Word Count: 39]

4. Finally, the operating system access controls will usually rely on hard-
ware features provided by the processor or by associated memory
management hardware. These control which memory addresses a given
process can access.

The access controls provided with an operating system typically authenticate
principals using a mechanism such as passwords or Kerberos, then mediate
their access to ﬁles, communications ports and other system resources.
Their effect can often be modelled by a matrix of access permissions, with
columns for ﬁles and rows for users. We’ll write r for permission to read, w
for permission to write, x for permission to execute a program, and - for no
access at all, as shown in Figure 4.2.

In Unix (including its popular variant Linux), ﬁles are not allowed to have
arbitrary access control lists, but simply rwx attributes for the resource owner,
the group, and the world. These attributes allow the ﬁle to be read, written
and executed. The access control list as normally displayed has a ﬂag to show
whether the ﬁle is a directory, then ﬂags r, w and x for world, group and owner
respectively; it then has the owner’s name and the group name. A directory
with all ﬂags set would have the ACL:

An Early Stream Cipher — The Vigen`ere
[Word Count: 8]

This early stream cipher is commonly ascribed to the Frenchman Blaise de
Vigen`ere, a diplomat who served King Charles IX. It works by adding a key
repeatedly into the plaintext using the convention that ‘A’ = 0, ‘B’ = 1, . . . ,
‘Z’ = 25, and addition is carried out modulo 26 — that is, if the result is greater
than 25, we subtract as many multiples of 26 as are needed to bring is into the
range [0, . . . , 25], that is, [A, . . . , Z]. Mathematicians write this as
[Word Count: 98]

So, for example, when we add P (15) to U (20) we get 35, which we reduce to
9 by subtracting 26.9 corresponds to J, so the encryption of P under the key U
(and of U under the key P) is J. In this notation, Julius Caesar’s system used a
[Word Count: 51]

ﬁxed key K = D1, while Augustus Caesar’s used K = C and Vigen`ere used a
repeating key, also known as a running key. Various means were developed
to do this addition quickly, including printed tables and, for ﬁeld use, cipher
wheels. Whatever the implementation technology, the encryption using a
repeated keyword for the key would look as shown in Figure 5.2:

One of the best-known early block ciphers is the Playfair system. It was
invented in 1854 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, a telegraph pioneer who
also invented the concertina and the Wheatstone bridge. The reason it’s
not called the Wheatstone cipher is that he demonstrated it to Baron Playfair,
a politician; Playfair in turn demonstrated it to Prince Albert and to Viscount
Palmerston (later Prime Minister), on a napkin after dinner.
This cipher uses a 5 by 5 grid, in which we place the alphabet, permuted by
the key word, and omitting the letter ‘J’ (see Figure 5.6):

The plaintext is ﬁrst conditioned by replacing ‘J’ with ‘I’ wherever it occurs,
then dividing it into letter pairs, preventing double letters occurring in a pair by
separating them with an ‘x’, and ﬁnally adding a ‘z’ if necessary to complete the
last letter pair. The example Playfair wrote on his napkin was ‘Lord Granville’s
letter’ which becomes ‘lo rd gr an vi lx le sl et te rz’.
It is then enciphered two letters at a time using the following rules:
[Word Count: 82]

if the two letters are in the same row or column, they are replaced by the
succeeding letters. For example, ‘am’ enciphers to ‘LE’
[Word Count: 24]

otherwise the two letters stand at two of the corners of a rectangle in
the table, and we replace them with the letters at the other two corners of
this rectangle. For example, ‘lo’ enciphers to ‘MT’.

The third classical type of cipher is the one-way function. This evolved to
protect the integrity and authenticity of messages, which as we’ve seen
is not protected at all by many simple ciphers where it is often easy to
manipulate the ciphertext in such a way as to cause a predictable change in the
plaintext.
After the invention of the telegraph in the mid-19th century, banks rapidly
became its main users and developed systems for transferring money elec-
tronically. Of course, it isn’t the money itself which is ‘wired’ but a payment
instruction, such as:

the sum of £1000 to John Smith of 456 Chesterton Road, who has an account with

A public-key encryption algorithm is a special kind of block cipher in which the
elf will perform the encryption corresponding to a particular key for anyone
who requests it, but will do the decryption operation only for the key’s owner.
To continue with our analogy, the user might give a secret name to the scroll
that only she and the elf know, use the elf’s public one-way function to

3. There is a decryption function which, applied to a ciphertext C using the
decryption key KR−1, will produce the original message M = {C}KR−1.
[Word Count: 25]

For practical purposes, we will want the oracle to be replicated at both ends
of the communications channel, and this means either using tamper-resistant
hardware or (more commonly) implementing its functions using mathematics
rather than metal. There are several more demanding models than this, for
example to analyze security in the case where the opponent can get ciphertexts
of his choice decrypted, with the exception of the target ciphertext. But this
will do for now.

SigσR(M) and the public signature veriﬁcation key VR will output TRUE
if the signature was computed correctly with σR and otherwise output
FALSE.
[Word Count: 34]

However, in the general case we do not need message recovery, as the
message to be signed may be of arbitrary length and so we will ﬁrst pass it
through a hash function and then sign the hash value. As hash functions are
one-way, the resulting compound signature scheme does not have message
recovery — although if the underlying signature scheme does, then the hash
of the message can be recovered from the signature.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
[Word Count: 6]

Figure 5.11: The AES linear transformation, illustrated by its effect on byte 3 of the input
[Word Count: 16]

Many block ciphers use a more complex structure, which was invented by
Feistel and his team while they were developing the Mark XII IFF in the late
1950’s and early 1960’s. Feistel then moved to IBM and founded a research
group which produced the Data Encryption Standard, (DES) algorithm, which
is still the mainstay of ﬁnancial transaction processing security.
A Feistel cipher has the ladder structure shown in Figure 5.12. The input is
split up into two blocks, the left half and the right half. A round function f1 of
[Word Count: 90]

the left half is computed and combined with the right half using exclusive-or
(binary addition without carry), though in some Feistel ciphers addition with
carry is also used. (We use the notation ⊕for exclusive-or.) Then, a function
f2 of the right half is computed and combined with the left half, and so
on. Finally (if the number of rounds is even) the left half and right half are
swapped.
[Word Count: 69]

Figure 5.12: The Feistel cipher structure
[Word Count: 6]

A notation which you may see for the Feistel cipher is ψ(f, g, h, . . .) where
f, g, h, . . . are the successive round functions. Under this notation, the above
cipher is ψ(f1, f2, . . . f2k−1, f2k). The basic result that enables us to decrypt a Feistel
cipher — and indeed the whole point of his design — is that:
[Word Count: 66]

ψ−1(f1, f2, . . . , f2k−1, f2k) = ψ(f2k, f2k−1, . . . , f2, f1)
[Word Count: 17]

In other words, to decrypt, we just use the round functions in the reverse
order. Thus the round functions fi do not have to be invertible, and the Feistel
structure lets us turn any one-way function into a block cipher. This means
that we are less constrained in trying to choose a round function with good
diffusion and confusion properties, and which also satisﬁes any other design
constraints such as code size, table size, software speed, hardware gate count,
and so on.
[Word Count: 82]

The DES algorithm is widely used in banking, government and embedded
applications. For example, it is the standard in automatic teller machine
networks. It is a Feistel cipher, with a 64-bit block and 56-bit key. Its round
function operates on 32-bit half blocks and consists of three operations:
[Word Count: 48]

ﬁrst, the block is expanded from 32 bits to 48;
[Word Count: 10]

next, 48 bits of round key are mixed in using exclusive-or;
[Word Count: 11]

the result is passed through a row of eight S-boxes, each of which takes a
six-bit input and provides a four-bit output;
[Word Count: 22]

ﬁnally, the bits of the output are permuted according to a ﬁxed pattern.
[Word Count: 13]

The effect of the expansion, key mixing and S-boxes is shown in Figure 5.13:
[Word Count: 14]

3DES(k0, k1, k2; M) = DES(k2; DES−1(k1; DES(k0; M)))
[Word Count: 9]

keys k1 and k2, xor’ing the ﬁrst with the plaintext before encryption and the
second with the output of the encryption to get the ciphertext afterwards. This
composite cipher is known as DESX, and is used in the Win2K encrypting ﬁle
system. Formally,
[Word Count: 43]

DESX(k0, k1, k2; M) = DES(k0; M ⊕k1) ⊕k2
[Word Count: 9]

It can be shown that, on reasonable assumptions, DESX has the properties
you’d expect; it inherits the differential strength of DES but its resistance to
keysearch is increased by the amount of the whitening [717]. Whitened block
ciphers are used in some applications.
[Word Count: 43]

In practice, how you use an encryption algorithm is often more important
than which one you pick. An important factor is the ‘mode of operation’, which
speciﬁes how a block cipher with a ﬁxed block size (8 bytes for DES, 16 for
AES) can be extended to process messages of arbitrary length.
There are several standard modes of operation for using a block cipher on
multiple blocks [944]. Understanding them, and choosing the right one for the
job, is an important factor in using a block cipher securely.
[Word Count: 88]

messages — would be foolish, as messages could be subject to a cut and splice
attack along the block boundaries. For example, if a bank message said ‘Please
pay account number X the sum Y, and their reference number is Z’ then an
attacker might initiate a payment designed so that some of the digits of X
could be replaced with some of the digits of Z.
[Word Count: 67]

Output feedback (OFB) mode consists of repeatedly encrypting an initial value
and using this as a keystream in a stream cipher of the kind discussed above.

CBC mode, too, the birthday theorem ensures that after about 2n/2 blocks, we
will start to see repeats. Counter mode encryption, however, has a guaranteed
cycle length of 2n rather than 2n/2.
[Word Count: 32]

The next ofﬁcial mode of operation of a block cipher is not used to encipher data,
but to protect its integrity and authenticity. This is the message authentication
code, or MAC. To compute a MAC on a message using a block cipher, we
encrypt it using CBC mode and throw away all the output ciphertext blocks
except the last one; this last block is the MAC. (The intermediate results are
kept secret in order to prevent splicing attacks.)

Common Hash Functions and Applications
[Word Count: 6]

Algorithms similar to Treyfer have been used in hash functions in key manage-
ment protocols in some pay-TV systems, but typically they have a modiﬁcation
to prevent ﬁxed-point attacks, such as a procedure to add in the round number
at each round, or to mix up the bits of the key in some way (a key scheduling
algorithm).
The most commonly used hash functions are all cryptographically suspect.
They are based on variants of a block cipher with a 512 bit key and a block size
of either 128 or 160 bits:
[Word Count: 92]

MD4 has three rounds and a 128 bit hash value, and a collision was
found for it in 1998 [394];
[Word Count: 20]

MD5 has four rounds and a 128 bit hash value, and a collision was found
for it in 2004 [1315, 1317];
[Word Count: 21]

the US Secure Hash Standard has ﬁve rounds and a 160 bit hash value,
and it was shown in 2005 that a collision can be found with a computa-
tional effort of 269 steps rather than the 280 that one would hope given its
block size [1316].
[Word Count: 47]

The block ciphers underlying these hash functions are similar: their round
function is a complicated mixture of the register operations available on 32 bit
processors [1125].
[Word Count: 26]

3Curiously, an S-box which is a permutation is always vulnerable, while a randomly selected
one isn’t quite so bad. In many cipher designs, S-boxes which are permutations are essential or
at least desirable. Treyfer is an exception.
[Word Count: 37]

Whoever knows the private key — the factors p and q of N — can easily cal-
culate
e√
[Word Count: 19]

C (mod N). As φ(N) = (p −1)(q −1) and e has no common factors with
φ(N), the key’s owner can ﬁnd a number d such that de ≡1 (mod φ(N)) — she
ﬁnds the value of d separately modulo p −1 and q −1, and combines the
answers.
e√
[Word Count: 50]

C (mod N) is now computed as Cd (mod N), and decryption works
because of Fermat’s theorem:
[Word Count: 17]

Cd ≡{Me}d ≡Med ≡M1+kφ(N) ≡M.Mkφ(N) ≡M.1 ≡M
(mod N)
[Word Count: 9]

Similarly, the owner of a private key can operate on a message with this to
produce a signature
[Word Count: 18]

and this signature can be veriﬁed by raising it to the power e mod N (thus,
using e and N as the public signature veriﬁcation key) and checking that the
message M is recovered:
[Word Count: 34]

Neither RSA encryption nor signature is generally safe to use on its own.
The reason is that, as encryption is an algebraic process, it preserves certain
algebraic properties. For example, if we have a relation such as M1M2 = M3

Thus 5 is a primitive root modulo 7. This means that given any y, we can
always solve the equation y = 5x (mod 7); x is then called the discrete logarithm
of y modulo 7. Small examples like this can be solved by inspection, but for a
large random prime number p, we do not know how to do this computation.
[Word Count: 62]

So the mapping f : x →gx (mod p) is a one-way function, with the additional
properties that f(x + y) = f(x)f(y) and f(nx) = f(x)n. In other words, it is a
one-way homomorphism. As such, it can be used to construct digital signature
and public key encryption algorithms.

Suppose that the base p and the generator g are public values chosen in some
suitable way, and that each user who wishes to sign messages has a private
signing key X and a public signature veriﬁcation key Y = gX. An ElGamal

signature scheme works as follows. Choose a message key k at random, and
form r = gk (mod p). Now form the signature s using a linear equation in k, r,
the message M and the private key X. There are a number of equations that
will do; the particular one that happens to be used in ElGamal signatures is

So s is computed as s = (M −rX)/k; this is done modulo φ(p). When both
sides are passed through our one-way homomorphism f(x) = gx mod p we get:

that their votes have been counted, but it’s also desirable that they should

Now that we can do public-key encryption and digital signature, we need
some mechanism to bind users to keys. The approach proposed by Difﬁe and
Hellman when they invented digital signatures was to have a directory of the
public keys of a system’s authorized users, like a phone book. A more common
[Word Count: 52]

solution, due to Loren Kohnfelder, is for a certiﬁcation authority (CA) to sign the
users’ public encryption and/or signature veriﬁcation keys giving certiﬁcates
that contain the user’s name, attributed such as authorizations, and public
keys. The CA might be run by the local system administrator; or it might be a
third party service such as Verisign whose business is to sign public keys after
doing some due diligence about whether they belong to the principals named
in them.
A certiﬁcate might be described symbolically as

two phases could be attacked halfway through the process by renaming an
object on which it acts. These problems have been around for a long time.

If two transactions arrive at the government’s bank account — say a credit of

may not matter much. But if they’re arriving at my bank account, the order will
have a huge effect on the outcome! In fact, the problem of deciding the order in
which transactions are applied has no clean solution. It’s closely related to the

Anyway, there are several possible approaches to the provision of secure

[Word Count: 38]

You could furnish every computer with a radio clock, but that can be
expensive, and radio clocks — even GPS — can be jammed if the oppo-
nent is serious.
[Word Count: 30]

There are clock synchronization protocols described in the research liter-
ature in which a number of clocks vote in a way that should make clock
failures and network delays apparent. Even though these are designed to
withstand random (rather than malicious) failure, they can no doubt be
hardened by having the messages digitally signed.
[Word Count: 54]

You can abandon absolute time and instead use Lamport time in which all
you care about is whether event A happened before event B, rather than
what date it is [766]. Using challenge-response rather than timestamps in
security protocols is an example of this; another is given by timestamp-
ing services that continually hash all documents presented to them into a
running total that’s published, and can thus provide proof that a certain
document existed by a certain date [572].
[Word Count: 80]

However, in most applications, you are likely to end up using the network
time protocol (NTP). This has a moderate amount of protection, with clock
voting and authentication of time servers. It is dependable enough for many
purposes.

much harder to build a resilient system using it. This has recently become a

6.4.1
The Distributed Systems View of Naming
[Word Count: 7]

During the last quarter of the twentieth century, the distributed systems
research community ran up against many naming problems. The basic algo-
rithm used to bind names to addresses is known as rendezvous: the principal
[Word Count: 35]

exporting a name advertises it somewhere, and the principal seeking to
import and use it searches for it. Obvious examples include phone books, and
directories in ﬁle systems.
However, the distributed systems community soon realised that naming
can get ﬁendishly complex, and the lessons learned are set out in a classic
article by Needham [958]. I’ll summarize the main points, and look at which
of them apply to secure systems.
[Word Count: 70]

3. It is bad to assume that only so many names will be needed. The shortage of
IP addresses, which motivated the development of IP version 6 (IPv6),
is well enough discussed. What is less well known is that the most
expensive upgrade which the credit card industry ever had to make
was not Y2K remediation, but the move from thirteen digit credit card
numbers to sixteen. Issuers originally assumed that 13 digits would
be enough, but the system ended up with tens of thousands of banks
(many with dozens of products) so a six digit bank identiﬁcation number
[Word Count: 99]

(BIN number) was needed. Some card issuers have millions of
customers, so a nine digit account number is the norm. And there’s also
a check digit (a one-digit linear combination of the other digits which is
appended to detect errors).
[Word Count: 40]

5. Names imply commitments, so keep the scheme ﬂexible enough to cope with
organizational changes. This sound principle was ignored in the design
of a UK government’s key management system for secure email [76].
There, principals’ private keys are generated by encrypting their names
under departmental master keys. So the frequent reorganizations meant
that the security infrastructure would have to be rebuilt each time —
and that money would have had to be spent solving many secondary
problems such as how people would access old material.
[Word Count: 86]

6. Names may double as access tickets, or capabilities. We have already seen
a number of examples of this in Chapters 2 and 3. In general, it’s a bad
idea to assume that today’s name won’t be tomorrow’s password or
capability — remember the Utrecht fraud we discussed in section 3.5.
(This is one of the arguments for making all names public keys — ‘keys
speak in cyberspace’ in Carl Ellison’s phrase — but we’ve already noted
the difﬁculties of linking keys with names.)
[Word Count: 84]

I’ve given a number of examples of how things go wrong when a name
starts being used as a password. But sometimes the roles of name and
password are ambiguous. In order to get entry to a car park I used to
use at the university, I had to speak my surname and parking badge
number into a microphone at the barrier. So if I say, ‘Anderson, 123’,
which of these is the password? In fact it was ‘Anderson’, as
anyone can walk through the car park and note down valid badge
[Word Count: 92]

numbers from the parking permits on the car windscreens. Another
example, from medical informatics, is a large database of medical
records kept by the UK government for research, where the name of the
patient has been replaced by their postcode and date of birth. Yet access
to many medical services requires the patient to give just these two
items to the receptionist to prove who they are. I will have more to say
on this later.
[Word Count: 76]

7. Things are made much simpler if an incorrect name is obvious. In standard
distributed systems, this enables us to take a liberal attitude to cacheing.
In payment systems, credit card numbers may be accepted while a ter-
minal is ofﬂine so long as the credit card number appears valid (i.e., the
last digit is a proper check digit of the ﬁrst ﬁfteen) and it is not on the
hot card list. Certiﬁcates provide a higher-quality implementation of
the same basic concept.
[Word Count: 82]

It’s important where the name is checked. The credit card check digit
algorithm is deployed at the point of sale, so it is public. A further
check — the card veriﬁcation value on the magnetic strip — is computed
with secret keys but can be checked at the issuing bank, the acquir-
ing bank or even at a network switch (if one trusts these third parties
with the keys). This is more expensive, and still vulnerable to network
outages.
[Word Count: 79]

Now, many ﬁrms propose moving to RFID chips that contain a glob-
ally unique number: an item code rather than a product code. This may
move name resolution upstream; rather than the shop’s
computer recognising that the customer has presented a packet of
vitamin C at the checkout, it may go to the manufacturer to ﬁnd this
[Word Count: 57]

out. Manufacturers push for this on safety grounds; they can then be
sure that the product hasn’t passed its sell-by date and has not been
recalled. But this also increases their power over the supply chain;
they can detect and stop gray-market trading that would otherwise
undermine their ability to charge different prices in different towns.
[Word Count: 56]

9. Don’t get too smart. Phone numbers are much more robust than computer
addresses. Amen to that — but it’s too often ignored by secure system
designers. Bank account numbers are much easier to deal with than
the public-key certiﬁcates which were once believed both necessary
and sufﬁcient to secure credit card payments online. I’ll discuss spe-
ciﬁc problems of public key infrastructures in section 21.4.5.7.
[Word Count: 66]

So Needham’s ten principles for distributed naming apply fairly directly to
distributed secure systems.
[Word Count: 14]

Needham’s principles, although very useful, are not sufﬁcient. They were
designed for a world in which naming systems could be designed and
imposed at the system owner’s convenience. When we move from distributed
systems in the abstract to the reality of modern web-based (and interlinked)
service industries, there is still more to say.
[Word Count: 53]

The most obvious difference is that the principals in security protocols may be
known by many different kinds of name — a bank account number, a company
registration number, a personal name plus a date of birth or a postal address,

Many secure distributed systems have incurred huge costs, or developed
serious vulnerabilities, because their designers ignored the basic lessons of
how to build (and how not to build) distributed systems. Most of these lessons
are still valid, and there are more to add.
A large number of security breaches are concurrency failures of one kind or
another; systems use old data, make updates inconsistently or in the wrong
order, or assume that data are consistent when they aren’t and can’t be.

A rapid way into the subject is to consider a simple textbook case of monopoly.
Suppose we have a market for apartments in a university town, and the
students have different incomes. We might have one rich student able to pay
$4000 a month, maybe 300 people willing to pay $2000 a month, and (to give
us round numbers) 1000 prepared to pay $1000 a month. That gives us the
demand curve shown in Figure 7.1 below.
[Word Count: 77]

One of the insights from the nineteenth-century economists Jevons and Menger
is that the price of a good, at equilibrium, is the marginal cost of production.
When coal cost nine shillings a ton in 1870, that didn’t mean that every mine
dug coal at this price, merely that the marginal producers — those who were
only just managing to stay in business — could sell at that price. If the price
went down, these mines would close; if it went up, other, even more marginal
mines, would open. That’s how supply responded to changes in demand.
[Word Count: 96]

2. There is often technical lock-in stemming from interoperability. Once a
software ﬁrm is committed to using Windows as a platform for its prod-
uct, it can be expensive to change; for users, too, changing platforms can
be expensive. They have to buy new software, convert ﬁles (if they can),
and retrain themselves.
[Word Count: 53]

These features separately can lead to industries with dominant ﬁrms;
together, they are even more likely to. If users simply want to be compat-
ible with other users (and software vendors) then they will logically buy from
the vendor they expect to win the biggest market share.
[Word Count: 47]

There is an interesting result, due to Shapiro and Varian: that the value of
a software company is the total lock-in (due to both technical and network
effects) of all its customers [1159]. To see how this might work, consider a ﬁrm
with 100 staff each using Ofﬁce, for which it has paid $500 per copy. It could

struggles set the scene in which more and more security products succeed

Each entry in the table shows ﬁrst Alice’s outcome and then Bob’s outcome.
Thus if the coins fall (H,H) Alice loses a penny and Bob gains a penny. This is
an example of a zero-sum game: Alice’s gain is Bob’s loss.
Often we can solve a game quickly by writing out a payoff matrix like this.
Here’s an example (Figure 7.3):
[Word Count: 61]

Figure 7.3: Dominant strategy equilibrium
[Word Count: 5]

In this game, no matter what Bob plays, Alice is better off playing ‘Bottom’;
and no matter what Alice plays, Bob is better off playing ‘Left’. Each player
has a dominant strategy — an optimal choice regardless of what the other does.
So Alice’s strategy should be a constant ‘Bottom’ and Bob’s a constant ‘Left’.
(A strategy in game theory is just an algorithm that takes a game state and
outputs a move.) We call this a dominant strategy equilibrium.
[Word Count: 80]

Here each player’s optimal strategy depends on what the other player does,
or (perhaps more accurately) what they think the other player will do. We
say that two strategies are in Nash equilibrium when Alice’s choice is optimal
given Bob’s, and vice versa. Here there are two symmetric Nash equilibria, at
top left and bottom right. You can think of them as being like local optima
while a dominant strategy equilibrium is a global optimum.

Many systems fail because the incentives are wrong, rather than because of
some technical design mistake. As a result, the security engineer needs to
[Word Count: 24]

understand basic economics as well as the basics of crypto, protocols, access
controls and psychology. Security economics is a rapidly growing research area
that explains many of the things that we used to consider just ‘bad weather’,
such as the insecurity of Windows. It constantly throws up fascinating new
insights into all sorts of questions from how to optimise the patching cycle
through whether people really care about privacy to what legislators might do
about DRM.
[Word Count: 76]

So far, two areas of economics have been explored for their relevance to
security, namely microeconomics and game theory. Behavioural economics

insights. But economics is a vast subject. What other ideas might it give us?

by deprived young males, an issue to which I’ll return in Chapter 11; but some

increasingly driven by the proﬁt motive rather than by ego and bragging
rights, we can expect economic analyses to be ever more useful.

I mentioned in the introduction that military database systems, which can
hold information at a number of different levels of classiﬁcation (Conﬁdential,
Secret, Top Secret, . . .), have to ensure that data can only be read by a principal
whose level is at least as high as the data’s classiﬁcation. The policies they
implement are known as multilevel secure or alternatively as mandatory access
control or MAC.
[Word Count: 68]

Multilevel secure systems are important because:
[Word Count: 6]

1. a huge amount of research has been done on them, thanks to military
funding for computer science in the USA. So the military model of protec-
tion has been worked out in much more detail than any other, and it gives
us a lot of examples of the second-order and even third-order effects of
implementing a security policy rigorously;

2. although multilevel concepts were originally developed to support con-
ﬁdentiality in military systems, many commercial systems now use mul-
tilevel integrity policies. For example, telecomms operators want their
billing system to be able to see what’s happening in their switching sys-
tem, but not affect it;
[Word Count: 47]

4. multilevel conﬁdentiality ideas are often applied in environments where
they’re ineffective or even harmful, because of the huge vested inter-
ests and momentum behind them. This can be a contributory factor in
the failure of large system projects, especially in the public sector.

Where a top-down approach to security engineering is possible, it will typi-
cally take the form of threat model — security policy — security mechanisms. The
critical, and often neglected, part of this process is the security policy.
By a security policy, we mean a document that expresses clearly and
concisely what the protection mechanisms are to achieve. It is driven by our
understanding of threats, and in turn drives our system design. It will often
take the form of statements about which users may access which data. It

It was in this context of the classiﬁcation of government data that the Bell-
LaPadula or BLP model of computer security was formulated in 1973 [146]. It
is also known as multilevel security and systems which implement it are often
called multilevel secure or MLS systems. Their basic property is that information
cannot ﬂow downwards.
More formally, the Bell-LaPadula model enforces two properties:
[Word Count: 63]

The simple security property: no process may read data at a higher level.
This is also known as no read up (NRU);
[Word Count: 22]

The *-property: no process may write data to a lower level. This is also
known as no write down (NWD).

were not in themselves enough. He introduced System Z, deﬁned as a BLP

Following some research products in the late 1970’s (such as KSOS [166],
a kernelised secure version of Unix), products that implemented multilevel
security policies started arriving in dribs and drabs in the early 1980’s. By
about 1988, a number of companies started implementing MLS versions of
their operating systems. MLS concepts were extended to all sorts of products.

MLS versions of Unix started to appear in the late 1980’s, such as AT&T’s Sys-
tem V/MLS [27]. This added security levels and labels, initially by using some
of the bits in the group id record and later by using this to point to a more elab-
orate structure. This enabled MLS properties to be introduced with minimal
changes to the system kernel. Other products of this kind included SecureWare

built from cheap commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components [689]. As the
cost of hardware falls, this is often the preferred option where it’s possible.
The pump’s story is told in [691].
The Australian government developed a product called Starlight that uses
pump-type technology married with a keyboard switch to provide a nice
MLS-type windowing system (albeit without any visible labels) using a bit
of trusted hardware which connects the keyboard and mouse with High and
Low systems [30]. There is no trusted software. It’s been integrated with the
NRL Pump [689]. A number of semi-commercial data diode products have
also been introduced.

One of the large applications of MLS is in wiretapping systems. Commu-
nications intelligence is generally fragile; once a target knows his trafﬁc is
being read he can usually do something to frustrate it. Traditional wiretap
kit, based on ‘loop extenders’ spliced into the line, could often be detected by
competent targets; modern digital systems try to avoid these problems, and

Multilevel integrity is coming to the mass market in Vista. As I already
mentioned, Vista essentially uses the Biba model. All processes do, and all
securable objects (including directories, ﬁles and registry keys) may, have an
integrity-level label. File objects are labelled at ‘Medium’ by default, while
Internet Explorer (and everything downloaded using it) is labelled ‘Low’. User
action is therefore needed to upgrade downloaded content before it can modify
[Word Count: 70]

The case of SELinux and Red Hat is somewhat similar to Vista in that the
immediate goal of the new mandatory access control mechanisms is also
to limit the effects of a compromise. SELinux [813] is based on the Flask
security architecture [1209], which separates the policy from the enforcement
mechanism; a security context contains all of the security attributes associated
with a subject or object in Flask, where one of those attributes includes
the Type Enforcement type attribute. A security identiﬁer is a handle to a
security context, mapped by the security server. It has a security server where

2Indeed, some of the mandatory access control mechanisms promised in Vista — such as remote
attestation — did not ship in the ﬁrst version, and there have been many papers from folks
at Microsoft Research on ways of managing access control and security policy in complex
middleware. Draw your own conclusions.

So virtualization should probably be seen as complementary to mandatory

As I’ve frequently pointed out, engineers learn more from the systems that fail
than from those that succeed, and MLS systems have certainly been an effective
teacher. The large effort expended in building systems to follow a simple policy
with a high level of assurance has led to the elucidation of many second- and
third-order consequences of information ﬂow controls. I’ll start with the more
theoretical and work through to the business and engineering end.

One of the reasons why these span limits are imposed on multilevel systems
emerges from a famous — and extensively studied — problem: the covert chan-

that was not designed for communication but which can nonetheless be abused
to allow information to be communicated down from High to Low.

So in many cases a TCB will provide some protection against viral attacks,
as well as against careless disclosure by users or application software — which
is often more important than malicious disclosure. However, the main effect
of viruses on military doctrine has been to strengthen the perceived case for
multilevel security. The argument goes that even if personnel can be trusted,
one cannot rely on technical measures short of total isolation to prevent viruses
moving up the system, so one must do whatever reasonably possible to stop
them signalling back down.

Multilevel secure systems are surprisingly expensive and difﬁcult to build and
deploy. There are many sources of cost and confusion.
[Word Count: 20]

1. MLS systems are built in small volumes, and often to high standards of
physical robustness, using elaborate documentation, testing and other
quality control measures driven by military purchasing bureaucracies.
[Word Count: 30]

2. MLS systems have idiosyncratic administration tools and procedures. A
trained Unix administrator can’t just take on an MLS installation without
signiﬁcant further training. A USAF survey showed that many MLS sys-
tems were installed without their features being used [1044].

license server which tracks licenses at all levels (this restricts your choice
of platforms), or (c) you only access the licensed software at one of the
levels.

4. Because processes are automatically upgraded as they see new labels, the
ﬁles they use have to be too. New ﬁles default to the highest label belong-
ing to any possible input. The result of all this is a chronic tendency for
things to be overclassiﬁed.
[Word Count: 46]

6. The classiﬁcation of data can get complex:
[Word Count: 8]

in the run-up to a military operation, the location of ‘innocuous’ stores
such as food could reveal tactical intentions, and so may be suddenly
upgraded. It follows that the tranquility property cannot simply be
assumed;
[Word Count: 35]

classiﬁcations are not necessarily monotone. Equipment classiﬁed at
‘conﬁdential’ in the peacetime inventory may easily contain compo-
nents classiﬁed ‘secret’;
[Word Count: 20]

we may need to worry about the volume of information available to
an attacker. For example, we might be happy to declassify any single
satellite photo, but declassifying the whole collection would reveal
our surveillance capability and the history of our intelligence priori-
ties. Similarly, the government payroll may not be very sensitive per
se, but it is well known that journalists can often identify intelligence
personnel working under civilian cover from studying the evolution of
[Word Count: 76]

departmental staff lists over a period of a few years. (I will look at this
issue — the ‘aggregation problem’ — in more detail in section 9.3.2.)
[Word Count: 27]

a related problem is that the output of an unclassiﬁed program acting
on unclassiﬁed data may be classiﬁed. This is also related to the aggre-
gation problem.
[Word Count: 27]

7. There are always system components — such as memory management —
that must be able to read and write at all levels. This objection is dealt
with by abstracting it away, and assuming that memory management is
part of the trusted computing base which enforces our mandatory access
control policy. The practical outcome is that often a quite uncomfortably
large part of the operating system (plus utilities, plus windowing system
software, plus middleware such as database software) ends up part of the
trusted computing base. ‘TCB bloat’ constantly pushes up the cost of eval-
uation and reduces assurance.
[Word Count: 99]

The reader’s reaction by this point may well be that mandatory access control
is too hard to do properly; there are just too many complications. This may be
true, and we are about to see the technology seriously tested as it’s deployed in
hundreds of millions of Vista PCs and Linux boxes. We will see to what extent
mandatory access control really helps contain the malware threat, whether
to commodity PCs or to servers in hosting centres. We’ll also see whether
variants of the problems described here cause serious or even fatal problems
for the DRM vision.

3Although senior people follow the ofﬁcial line when speaking on the record, once in private
they rail at the penalties imposed by the bureaucracy. My favorite quip is from an exasperated
British general: ‘What’s the difference between Jurassic Park and the Ministry of Defence? One’s
a theme park full of dinosaurs, and the other’s a movie!’
[Word Count: 56]

Mandatory access control was developed for military applications, most
notably specialized kinds of ﬁrewalls (guards and pumps). They are being
incorporated into commodity platforms such as Vista and Linux. They have
even broader importance in that they have been the main subject of computer
security research since the mid-1970’s, and their assumptions underlie many
of the schemes used for security evaluation. It is important for the practitioner
to understand both their strengths and limitations, so that you can draw on
the considerable research literature when it’s appropriate, and avoid being
dragged into error when it’s not.

There are (at least) three different models of how to implement access controls
and information ﬂow controls in a multilateral security model. These are
compartmentation, used by the intelligence community; the Chinese Wall
model, which describes the mechanisms used to prevent conﬂicts of interest
in professional practice; and the BMA model, developed by the British Medical
Association to describe the information ﬂows permitted by medical ethics.
Each of these has potential applications outside its initial ﬁeld.

their access control list already has access to personal health information
on a large number of people.

In a top-down approach to security engineering, one should ﬁrst determine

BMA-compliant systems have now been implemented both in general
practice [585], and in a hospital system developed in Hastings, England, that

rules such as ‘a ward nurse can see the records of all patients who have within

2. In order to access patient data, a staff member will also need a legitimate
relationship. This is an abstraction of the Hastings idea of ‘her department’.

3. By default each patient has a single electronic patient record. However,
patients will also be able to declare that certain parts of their records are
either ‘sealed’ or ‘sealed and locked’. In the latter case, the records will
only be visible to a particular care team. In the former, their existence will

be visible to other staff who look at the patient record, and who will be

[Word Count: 23]

that tell you? You’d better ﬁnd out2. But many ﬁelded systems don’t have rate
controls, or effective alarms, and even where alarms exist they are often not
acted on. Again in the UK, over 50 hospital staff looked at the records of a
footballing personality in hospital, despite not being involved in his care, and
none of them was disciplined.
And even apart from controversial uses of medical records, such as police
access, there are serious problems in protecting relatively uncontroversial uses,
such as research. I’ll turn to that next.
[Word Count: 90]

Access control in medical record systems is hard enough in hospitals and
clinics that care for patients directly. It is much harder to assure patient
privacy in secondary applications such as databases for research, cost control
and clinical audit. This is one respect in which doctors have a harder time
protecting their data than lawyers; lawyers can lock up their conﬁdential client
ﬁles and never let any outsider see them at all, while doctors are under all
sorts of pressures to share data with third parties.

techniques include, as I mentioned, suppressing data with extreme values. A
census bureau may deal with high-net-worth individuals in national statistics

but not in the local ﬁgures, while some medical databases do the same for less
common diseases. For example, a UK prescribing statistics system suppresses
sales of the AIDS drug AZT from local statistics [847]. When it was designed
in the late 1990s, there were counties with only one single patient receiving
this drug.

2. Thus, for example, the cards and PINs are sent to the customer via sep-
arate channels. The cards are personalized in a facility with embossing
and mag strip printing machinery, and the PIN mailers are printed in a
separate facility containing a printer attached to a security module.

3. A terminal master key is supplied to each ATM in the form of two printed
components, which are carried to the branch by two separate ofﬁcials,
input at the ATM keyboard, and combined to form the key. Similar pro-
cedures (but with three ofﬁcials) are used to set up master keys between
banks and network switches such as VISA.
[Word Count: 60]

4. If ATMs are to perform PIN veriﬁcation locally, then the PIN key is
encrypted under the terminal master key and then sent to the ATM.
[Word Count: 26]

5. If the PIN veriﬁcation is to be done centrally over the network, the PIN
is encrypted under a key set up using the terminal master key. It will
then be sent from the ATM to a central security module for checking.

When people started building ATM networks in the mid 1980s, many
banks used software encryption rather than hardware security mod-
ules to support ATMs. So in theory, any bank’s programmers might
get access to the PINs of any other bank’s customers. The remedy was
to push through standards for security module use. In many countries
[Word Count: 55]

(such as the USA), these standards were largely ignored; but even where
they were respected, some banks continued using software for transac-
tions involving their own customers. So some keys (such as those used
to communicate with ATMs) had to be available in software too, and
knowledge of these keys could be used to compromise the PINs of other
banks’ customers. (I’ll explain this in more detail later.) So the protection
given by the hardware TCB was rarely complete.

is like the three-digit security code on the signature strip, but different
digits; each is computed from the account number and expiry date by
encrypting them with a suitable key). Surprisingly, it still happens; I
have a letter from a UK bank dated May 2007 claiming that a series of
terrorist-related ATM frauds were perpetrated using closed-circuit TV.
This amounts to an admission that the CVV is not always checked.

There were some losses due to programming errors by banks. One small
institution issued the same PIN to all its customers; another bank’s cash
machines had the feature that when a telephone card was entered at an
ATM, it believed that the previous card had been inserted again. Crooks
stood in line, observed customers’ PINs, and helped themselves.
[Word Count: 58]

Several banks thought up check-digit schemes to enable PINs to be
checked by ofﬂine ATMs without having to give them the bank’s
PIN key. For example, customers of one British bank get a credit
card PIN with digit one plus digit four equal to digit two plus digit
three, and a debit card PIN with one plus three equals two plus four.
Crooks found they could use stolen cards in ofﬂine devices by enter-
ing a PIN such as 4455.

Many banks’ operational security procedures were simply dire. In
August 1993, my wife went into a branch of our bank with a witness and
told them she’d forgotten her PIN. The teller helpfully printed her a new
PIN mailer from a printer attached to a PC behind the counter — just
like that! It was not the branch where our account is kept. Nobody knew
her and all the identiﬁcation she offered was our bank card and her
checkbook. When anyone who’s snatched a handbag can walk in off

the street and get a PIN for the card in it at any branch, no amount of
encryption technology will do much good. (The bank in question has
since fallen victim to a takeover.)

In the USA, the banks have to carry the risks associated with new technology.

Online Credit Card Fraud — the Hype
and the Reality
[Word Count: 11]

In the 1960s and 70s, various people proposed putting integrated circuits
in bank cards. The Germans consider the smartcard to have been invented
by Helmut Gr¨ottrup and J¨urgen Dethloff in 1968, when they proposed and
patented putting a custom IC in a card 1968; the French credit Roland Moreno,
who proposed putting memory chips in cards in 1973, and Michel Ugon who
proposed adding a microprocessor in 1977. The French company Honeywell-
Bull patented a chip containing memory, a microcontroller and everything
else needed to do transactions in 1982; they started being used in French

CDA is the Rolls-Royce of EMV protocols. it’s like DDA except that the card
also computes a signature on the MAC. This ties the transaction data to the
public key and to the fact that a PIN veriﬁcation was performed (assuming,
that is, the bank selected the option of including a PIN-veriﬁcation ﬂag in in
the transaction data).
[Word Count: 58]

In the USA, where thanks to the Federal Reserve the incentives facing banks and
merchants are less perverted, the banking industry has remained unconvinced
that the multibillion-dollar costs of moving to EMV would be justiﬁed by any
reductions in losses. Rather than moving to EMV, the industry has preferred
to skip a generation and wait for the next payment method — so-called ‘RFID’
or ‘contactless’ payment cards.

Physical protection is no different at heart from computer security: you
perform a threat analysis, then design a system that involves equipment and
procedures, then test it. The system itself typically has a number of elements:
[Word Count: 36]

An important design consideration is the level of skill, equipment and moti-
vation that the attacker might have. Movies like ‘Entrapment’ might be good
entertainment, but don’t give a realistic view of the world of theft. As we have
seen in one context after another, ‘security’ isn’t a scalar. It doesn’t make sense
to ask ‘Is device X secure?’ without a context: ‘secure against whom and in
what environment?’

Anyway, once you’ve decided what environmental features you’ll use to deter
Derek or Charlie from trying to break into your site, and how you make it
harder for Bruno to ﬁnd out which of your sites he should break into, you then
have the problem of designing the physical barriers.
The ﬁrst task is to ﬁgure out what you’re really trying to protect. In the old
days, banks used to go to great lengths to make life really tough for robbers,
but this has its limits: a robber can always threaten to shoot a customer. So
[Word Count: 96]

such as shaped charges, they can get through almost anything in seconds.
Another issue is the thermic lance, or burning bar, which will cut through
most barrier materials quickly: safe engineers use them to get into a vault
whose combination has been lost. Robbers can get them too. So barriers can’t
be seen in isolation. You have to evaluate them in the context of assumptions
about the threats, and about the intrusion detection and response on which
you can rely.

and sophisticated aspect of physical security, namely alarms.
[Word Count: 59]

A Picasso is stolen from a gallery with supposedly ‘state-of-the-art’ alarm systems
by a thief who removes a dozen rooﬁng tiles and lowers himself down a rope so as
not to activate the pressure mats under the carpet. He grabs the painting, climbs
back out without touching the ﬂoor, and probably sells the thing for a quarter of
a million dollars to a wealthy cocaine dealer.
[Word Count: 66]

The press loves this kind of stuff, and it does happen from time to time.
Reality is both simpler and stranger. Let’s work through the threat scenarios
systematically.
[Word Count: 28]

A common mistake when designing alarm systems is to be captivated by
the latest sensor technology. There’s a lot of impressive stuff on the market,
such as a ﬁber optic cable which you can loop round protected objects and
which will alarm if the cable is stretched or relaxed by less than 100nm — a
ten-thousandth of a millimeter. Isn’t modern science marvellous? So the naive
art gallery owner will buy a few feet of this magic cable, glue it to the back of
his prize Picasso and connect it to an alarm company.

Bruno’s attack is to visit as a tourist and hide in a broom cupboard. At one in the
morning, he emerges, snatches the painting and heads for the ﬁre exit. Off goes

the time the cops arrive twelve minutes later he has vanished.
[Word Count: 60]

deterrence. At the sort of targets Abdurrahman’s interested in, an attack will
almost certainly be detected; the main problem is to delay him long enough
for the Marines to arrive. Bruno is the most interesting case as we won’t have
the military budget to spend on keeping him out, and there are many more
premises whose defenders worry about Bruno than about Abdurrahman. So
you have to look carefully at the circumstances, and decide whether the bigger
problem is with detection, with delay or with response.
[Word Count: 86]

Burglar alarms use a wide range of sensors, including:
[Word Count: 9]

vibration detectors, to sense fence disturbance, footsteps, breaking glass
or other attacks on buildings or perimeters;
[Word Count: 16]

passive infrared devices to detect body heat;
[Word Count: 7]

motion detectors using ultrasonics or microwave;
[Word Count: 6]

invisible barriers of microwave or infrared beams;
[Word Count: 7]

pressure pads under the carpet, which in extreme cases may extend to
instrumenting the entire ﬂoor with pressure transducers under each tile;
[Word Count: 22]

video cameras, maybe with movement detectors, to alarm automatically
or provide a live video feed to a monitoring center;
[Word Count: 19]

movement sensors on equipment, ranging from simple tie-down cables
through seismometers to loops of optical ﬁber.
[Word Count: 16]

can control the environment and so the lower the achievable false alarm rate.
Conversely, at the perimeter it’s hard to keep the false alarm rate down. But to
delay an intruder long enough for the guards to get there, the outer perimeter
is exactly where you need reliable sensors.
[Word Count: 49]

So Bruno’s next attack is to wait for a dark and stormy night. He sets off the
alarm somehow, taking care not to get caught on CCTV or otherwise leave any
hard evidence that the alarm was a real one. He retires a few hundred yards and
hides in the bushes. The guards come out and ﬁnd nothing. He waits half an hour
and sets off the alarm again. This time the guards don’t bother, so in he goes.
[Word Count: 79]

Intruder alarms and barriers interact in a number of ways with other services.
The most obvious of these is electricity. A power cut will leave many sites
dark and unprotected, so a serious alarm installation needs backup power. A
less obvious interaction is with ﬁre alarms and ﬁreﬁghting.
[Word Count: 48]

to a few inches and you are disoriented by the terrible shrieking noise of the
dump. A malfunctioning intruder alarm that let a drunk into your computer
room, where he lit up a cigarette and was promptly executed by your ﬁre
extinguisher, might raise a few chuckles among the anti-smoking militants but
is unlikely to make your lawyers very happy.
In any case, the most severe feature interactions are between alarm and
communication systems.
[Word Count: 74]

A sophisticated attacker is at least as likely to attack the communications as
the sensors. Sometimes this will mean the cabling between the sensors and the
alarm controller.
[Word Count: 28]

Bruno goes into an art gallery and, while the staff are distracted, he cuts the wire
from a window switch. He goes back that evening and helps himself.
[Word Count: 28]

Bruno phones up his rival gallery claiming to be from the security company that
handles their alarms. He says that they’re updating their computers so could
[Word Count: 26]

they please tell him the serial number on their alarm controller unit? An ofﬁce
junior helpfully does so — not realising that the serial number on the box is also
the cryptographic key that secures the communications. Bruno buys an identical
controller for $200 and, after half an hour learning how to use an EEPROM
programmer, he has a functionally identical unit which he splices into his rival’s
phone line. This continues to report ‘all’s well’ even when it isn’t.
[Word Count: 80]

Bruno cuts the telephone line to his rival’s gallery and hides a few hundred yards
away in the bushes. He counts the number of men in blue uniforms who arrive,
[Word Count: 30]

and the number who depart. If the two numbers are equal, then it’s a fair guess
the custodian has said, ‘Oh bother, we‘ll ﬁx it in the morning’, or words to that
effect. He now knows he has several hours to work.
[Word Count: 42]

The reader might still ask why a book that’s essentially about security in
computer systems should spend several pages describing walls, locks and
alarm systems. There are many reasons.
[Word Count: 29]

Dealing with service denial attacks is the hardest part of many secure
system designs. As the bad guys come to understand system level vul-
nerabilities, it’s also often the most important. Intruder alarms give us
one of the largest available bodies of applicable knowledge and
experience.
[Word Count: 46]

The lesson that one must look at the overall system — from intrusion
through detection, alarm, delay and response — is widely applicable,
yet increasingly hard to follow in general purpose distributed systems.
[Word Count: 33]

The observation that the outermost perimeter defenses are the ones that
you’d most like to rely on, but also the ones on which the least reliance
can be placed, is also quite general.
[Word Count: 33]

The trade-off between the missed alarm rate and the false alarm rate —
the receiver operating characteristic — is a pervasive problem in security
engineering.
[Word Count: 25]

1I used to wonder, back in the days when I was a banker, whether two bad men who practised
a bit could cut both cables simultaneously. I concluded that the threat wasn’t worth bothering
about for bank branches with a mere $100,000 or so in the vault. Our large cash processing centers
were staffed 24 by 7, so the threat model there focused on dishonest insiders, hostage taking and
so on.
[Word Count: 71]

Failure to understand the threat model — designing for Charlie and hop-
ing to keep out Bruno — causes many real life failures. It’s necessary to
know what actually goes wrong, not just what crime writers think goes
wrong.

And ﬁnally, you can’t just leave the technical aspects of a security engi-
neering project to specialist subcontractors, as critical stuff will always
fall down between the cracks.

As well as these system-level lessons, there are a number of other applica-
tions where the experience of the burglar alarm industry is relevant. I already
mentioned improvised explosive devices; in a later chapter, I’ll discuss tamper-
resistant processors that are designed to detect attempts to dismantle them
and respond by destroying all their cryptographic key material.

widely-used high-security locks. The bump keys and other tools needed for
such attacks on many locks are easily available online.
Third, there’s quite a lot to learn from the one aspect of physical security
that is already fairly well automated, namely alarms. Alarms provide us with
a good example of a system whose security policy hinges on availability rather
than on conﬁdentiality or integrity. They can give us some useful insights
when dealing with service-denial attacks in other contexts.

The security requirements for prepayment meters seem straightforward.
Tokens should not be easy to forge, while genuine tokens should not work

tokens tamper-resistant, by using smartcard chips of some kind or another;

prepayment may be cheap so long as you control the marketing
channel, but when you try to make it even cheaper by selling prepay-

because of the security engineering problems created by mutual mistrust
between the various organizations involved;
[Word Count: 60]

changes to a business process can be very expensive if they affect the
security infrastructure. For example, the requirement to sell meter tokens
at distant shops, to support commuters, was not anticipated and was
costly to implement;

Many security systems are concerned one way or another with monitoring or
metering some aspect of the environment. They range from utility meters to taxi
meters, tachographs, and postal meters. We’ll come across further metering
and payment systems in later chapters, ranging from the mechanisms used to
stop printer cartridges working once they have printed a certain number of
pages, to prepay scratch cards for mobile phone use, which may be the world’s
largest application-speciﬁc payment mechanism.

Authorization, Environment, Intent
[Word Count: 4]

So the deep question was the security policy that nuclear safety systems, and
command systems, should enforce. What emerged was the rule of ‘authoriza-
tion, environment, intent’. For a warhead to detonate, three conditions must
be met.
[Word Count: 37]

Authorization: the use of the weapon in question must have been authorized
by the national command authority (i.e., the President and his lawful
successors in ofﬁce).
[Word Count: 26]

Environment: the weapon must have sensed the appropriate aspect of the
environment. (With atomic demolition munitions, this requirement is
replaced by the use of a special container.)
[Word Count: 27]

Intent: the ofﬁcer commanding the aircraft, ship or other unit must unam-
biguously command the weapon’s use.
[Word Count: 17]

In early systems, ‘authorization’ meant the entry into the device of a
four-digit authorization code.
The means of signalling ‘intent’ depended on the platform. Aircraft typically
use a six-digit arming or ‘use control’ code. The command consoles for

intercontinental ballistic missiles are operated by two ofﬁcers, each of whom
must enter and turn a key to launch the rocket. Whatever the implementation,
the common concept is that there must be a unique signal; the effectively 22 bits
derived from a six-digit code is believed to be a good tradeoff between a number
of factors from usability to minimising the risk of accidental arming [908].

So ‘Attack Russia’ is ‘686’ (or ‘12’) and ‘Attack China’ is ‘349’.
An enemy who has taken over the communications channel between the

has a probability of only 1 in 337 of successfully impersonating the commander.

enough in command applications, as one cannot be sure that the personnel
operating the equipment will consent, without discussion or query, to unleash
Armageddon. So a more general approach was invented independently by
Blakley and Shamir in 1979 [181, 1146]. Their basic idea is illustrated in the

use control code.

after tests showed that 1 mm chip fragments survived the protective det-
onation of a control device carried aboard airborne command posts, the
software was rewritten so that all key material was stored as two sep-
arate components, which were kept at addresses more than 1 mm apart
on the chip surface;
[Word Count: 52]

the ‘football’, the command device carried around behind the President,
is said to be as thick as it is because of fear that shaped charges might be
used to disable its protective mechanisms. (This may or may not be an
urban myth.) Shaped charges can generate a plasma jet with a velocity
of 8000m/s, which could in theory be used to disable tamper sensing cir-
cuitry. So some distance may be needed to give the alarm circuit enough
time to zeroize the code memory.
[Word Count: 84]

This care must extend to many details of implementation and operation.
The weapons testing process includes not just independent veriﬁcation and
validation, but hostile ‘black hat’ penetration attempts by competing agencies.
Even then, all practical measures are taken to prevent access by possible
opponents. The devices (both munition and control) are defended in depth by
armed forces; there are frequent zero-notice challenge inspections; and staff
may be made to re-sit the relevant examinations at any time of the day or
night.

The research problem I set at the end of this chapter in the ﬁrst edition in 2001

Many computer systems rely to some extent on secure printing, packaging
and seals to guarantee important aspects of their protection.
[Word Count: 20]

Most security products can be defeated if a bad man can get at them
— whether to patch them, damage them, or substitute them — before
you install them. Seals, and tamper-evident packaging generally, can
help with trusted distribution, that is, assuring the user that the product
hasn’t been tampered with since leaving the factory.
[Word Count: 55]

Many software products get some protection against forgery using seals
and packaging. They can at least raise the costs of large-scale forgery
somewhat.
[Word Count: 23]

We saw how monitoring systems, such as taxi meters, often use seals to
make it harder for users to tamper with input. No matter how sophis-

attacks. If you’re scrutinising the ID of an engineer from one of your
suppliers before you let him into your hosting centre, it can be a good
idea to eyeball the ID as well as reading it electronically. If all you
do is the latter, he might be relaying the transaction to somewhere
else. So even with electronic ID cards, the security printing can still
matter.

The introduction of paper money into Europe by Napoleon in the early 1800s,
and of other valuable documents such as bearer securities and passports,
kicked off a battle between security printers and counterfeiters that exhibits
many of the characteristics of a coevolution of predators and prey. Photography
(1839) helped the attackers, then color printing and steel etching (1850s) the
defenders. In recent years, the color copier and the cheap scanner have been

enough to pass a bank teller, but are uttered in places such as dark and noisy
nightclubs.
The industry distinguishes three different levels of inspection which a forged
banknote or document may or may not pass [1279]:
[Word Count: 37]

1. a primary inspection is one performed by an untrained inexperienced
person, such as a member of the public or a new cashier at a store. Often
the primary inspector has no motivation, or even a negative motivation.
If he gets a banknote that feels slightly dodgy, he may try to pass it on
without looking at it closely enough to have to decide between becoming
an accomplice or going to the hassle of reporting it;
[Word Count: 76]

2. a secondary inspection is one performed in the ﬁeld by a competent
and motivated person, such as an experienced bank teller in the case
of banknotes or a trained manufacturer’s inspector in the case of product
labels. This person may have some special equipment such as an ultra-
violet lamp, a pen with a chemical reagent, or even a scanner and a PC.
However the equipment will be limited in both cost and bulk, and will
be completely understood by serious counterfeiters;
[Word Count: 83]

3. a tertiary inspection is one performed at the laboratory of the manufac-
turer or the note issuing bank. The experts who designed the security
printing (and perhaps even the underlying industrial processes) will be
on hand, with substantial equipment and support.
[Word Count: 42]

Traditional security documents utilize a number of printing processes,
including:
[Word Count: 10]

intaglio, a process where an engraved pattern is used to press the ink on
to the paper with great force, leaving a raised ink impression with high
deﬁnition. This is often used for scroll work on banknotes and passports;
[Word Count: 39]

438
Chapter 14
■Security Printing and Seals
[Word Count: 7]

letterpress in which the ink is rolled on raised type that is then pressed on
to the page, leaving a depression. The numbers on banknotes are usu-
ally printed this way, often with numbers of different sizes and using
different inks to prevent off-the-shelf numbering equipment being used;
[Word Count: 48]

special printing presses, called Simultan presses, which transfer all the
inks, for both front and back, to the paper simultaneously. The print-
ing on front and back can therefore be accurately aligned; patterns can
be printed partly on the front and partly on the back so that they match
up perfectly when the note is held up to the light (see-through register).
Reproducing this is believed to be hard on cheap color printing equip-
ment. The Simultan presses also have the special ducting to make ink
colors vary along the line (rainbowing);
[Word Count: 92]

rubber stamps that are used to endorse documents, or to seal photo-
graphs to them;
[Word Count: 15]

embossing and laminates that are also used to seal photographs, and on
bank cards to push up the cost of forgery. Embossing can be physical,
or use laser engraving techniques to burn a photo into an ID card;
[Word Count: 38]

watermarks are an example of putting protection features in the paper.
They are more translucent areas inserted into the paper by varying its
thickness when it is manufactured. Many other special materials, such as
ﬂuorescent threads, are used for similar purposes. An extreme example
is the Australian $10 note, which is printed on plastic and has a see-
through window.
[Word Count: 60]

optically variable inks, such as the patches on Canadian $20 bills that
change color from green to gold depending on the viewing angle;
[Word Count: 23]

inks with magnetic, photochromic or thermochromic properties;
[Word Count: 7]

printing features visible only with special equipment, such as the micro-
printing on US bills which requires a magnifying glass to see, and print-
ing in ultraviolet, infrared or magnetic inks (the last of these being used
in the black printing on US bills);
[Word Count: 44]

metal threads and foils, from simple iridescent features to foil color
copying through to foils with optically variable effects such as holo-
grams and kinegrams, as found on the latest issue of British banknotes.
Holograms are typically produced optically, and look like a solid object
behind the ﬁlm, while kinegrams are produced by computer and may
show a number of startlingly different views from slightly different
angles;
[Word Count: 67]

screen traps such as details too faint to scan properly, and alias band struc-
tures which contain detail at the correct size to form interference effects
with the dot separation of common scanners and copiers;
[Word Count: 35]

digital copyright marks which may vary from images hidden by micro-
printing their Fourier transforms directly, to spread spectrum signals
that will be recognized by a color copier, scanner or printer and cause it
to stop;
[Word Count: 36]

unique stock, such as paper with magnetic ﬁbers randomly spread
through it during manufacture so that each sheet has a characteristic
pattern that can be digitally signed and printed on the document using
a barcode.

This discussion suggests a systematic way to evaluate a seal product for a
given application. Rather than just asking, ‘Can you remove the seal in ways
other than the obvious one?’ we need to follow it from design and ﬁeld
test through manufacture, application, use, checking, destruction and ﬁnally
retirement from service. Here are some of the questions that should be asked:
[Word Count: 62]

If a seal is forged, who’s supposed to spot it? If it’s the public, then how
often will they see genuine seals? Has the vendor done experiments,
that pass muster by the standards of applied psychology, to establish
the likely false accept and false reject rates? If it’s your inspectors in the
ﬁeld, how much will their equipment and training cost? And how well
are these inspectors — public or professional — really motivated to ﬁnd
and report defects?
[Word Count: 79]

Has anybody who really knows what they’re doing tried hard to defeat
the system? And what’s a defeat anyway — tampering, forgery, alter-
ation, erosion of evidential value or a ‘PR’ attack on your commercial
credibility?
[Word Count: 36]

What is the reputation of the team that designed it — did they have a
history of successfully defeating opponents’ products?
[Word Count: 21]

How long has it been in the ﬁeld, and how likely is it that progress will
make a defeat signiﬁcantly easier?
[Word Count: 21]

How widely available are the sealing materials — who else can buy,
forge or steal supplies?
[Word Count: 16]

Will the person who applies the seal be careless or corrupt, and if so,
how will you cope with that?
[Word Count: 20]

Does the way the seal will be used protect the right part (or enough) of
the product?
[Word Count: 17]

What are the quality issues? What about the effects of dirt, oil, noise,
vibration, cleaning, and manufacturing defects? Will the product have to
survive outdoor weather, petrol splashes, being carried next to the skin
or being dropped in a glass of beer? Or is it supposed to respond visibly
if such a thing happens? How often will there be random seal failures
and what effect will they have?
[Word Count: 68]

Are there any evidential issues? If you’re going to end up in court, are
there experts other than your own (or the vendor’s) on whom the other
[Word Count: 27]

side can rely? If the answer is no, then is this a good thing or a bad thing?
Why should the jury believe you, the system’s inventor, rather than the
sweet little old lady in the dock? Will the judge let her off on fair trial
grounds — because rebutting your technical claims would be an impos-
sible burden of proof for her to discharge? (This is exactly what hap-
pened in Judd vs Citibank, the case which settled US law on ‘phantom
withdrawals’ from cash machines [674].)
[Word Count: 88]

Once the product is used, how will the seals be disposed of — are you
bothered if someone recovers a few old seals from the trash?
[Word Count: 26]

Most commercially available sealing products are relatively easy to defeat,
and this is particularly true when seal inspection is performed casually by
untrained personnel. Sealing has to be evaluated over the whole lifetime of the
seal from manufacture through materials control, application, veriﬁcation and
eventual destruction; hostile testing is highly advisable in critical applications.
Seals often depend on security printing, about which broadly similar comments
may be made.

Biometric systems market was reportedly worth over $1.5bn in 2005 [675], a
massive increase from $50 m in 1998 [655]. I already mentioned the use of
hand geometry to identify staff at a nuclear reactor in the late 1970s. But the
best established biometric techniques predate the computer age altogether —
namely the use of handwritten signatures, facial features and ﬁngerprints. I
will look at these ﬁrst, then go on to the fancier, more ‘high-tech’ techniques.

closed to open systems, from small systems to large ones, from attended to
stand-alone, from cooperative to recalcitrant subjects, and from veriﬁcation to
identiﬁcation, can all undermine a system’s viability.
There are a number of interesting attacks that are more speciﬁc to biometric
systems and that apply to more than one type of biometric.
[Word Count: 64]

Most biometrics are not as accurate for all people, and some of the pop-
ulation can’t be identiﬁed as reliably as the rest (or even at all). The
elderly, and manual workers, often have damaged or abraded ﬁnger-
prints. People with dark eyes, and large pupils, give poorer iris codes.
Disabled people with no ﬁngers, or no eyes, risk exclusion if such sys-
tems become widespread. Illiterates who make an ‘X’ are more at risk
from signature forgery.
[Word Count: 78]

Biometric engineers sometimes refer to such subjects dismissively as
goats, but this is foolish and offensive. A biometric system that is (or is
seen to be) socially regressive — that puts the disabled, the poor, the old
and ethnic minorities at greater risk of impersonation — may meet with
[Word Count: 49]

principled resistance. In fact a biometric system might be defeated by
legal challenges on a number of grounds [1046]. It may also be vulner-
able to villains who are (or pretend to be) disabled. Fallback modes of
operation will have to be provided. If these are less secure, then forcing
their use may yield an attack, and if they are at least as secure, then why
use biometrics at all?
[Word Count: 70]

Many vendors have claimed that their products protect privacy, as
what’s stored is not the image of your face or ﬁngerprint or iris, but
rather a template that’s derived from it, somewhat like a one-way hash,
and from which you can’t be identiﬁed. It’s been argued from this that
biometric data are not personal data, in terms of privacy law, and can
thus be passed around without restriction. These claims were exploded
[Word Count: 72]

by Andy Adler who came up with an interesting hill-climbing attack on
face recognition systems. Given a recogniser that outputs how close an
input image is to a target template, the input face is successively altered
to increase the match. With the tested systems, this led rapidly to a rec-
ognizable image of the target — a printout of which would be accepted
as the target’s face [14]. He then showed how this hill-climbing tech-
nique could be used to attack other biometrics, including some based on
ﬁngerprints [15].
[Word Count: 89]

him the three best matches plus two poor matches, would that work any
better?
[Word Count: 14]

Finally, Christian fundamentalists are uneasy about biometric technol-
ogy. They ﬁnd written of the Antichrist in Revelation 13:16-18: ‘And he
causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a
mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy
or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the num-
ber of his name.’ So biometrics may arouse political opposition on the
right as well as the left.
[Word Count: 85]

So there are some non-trivial problems to be overcome as biometrics tiptoe
towards mass-market use. But despite the cost and the error rates, they have
proved their worth in a number of applications — most notably where their
deterrent effect is useful.
[Word Count: 42]

It is relatively easy to build an encryption system that is secure if it is working as
intended and is used correctly but it is still very hard to build a system that does not
compromise its security in situations in which it is either misused or one or more of
its sub-components fails (or is ’encouraged’ to misbehave) . . . this is now the only
area where the closed world is still a long way ahead of the open world and the
many failures we see in commercial cryptographic systems provide some evidence
for this.

How to hack a cryptoprocessor (7)
I don’t know how to attack the hardware of the 4758. My students and I found
a number of novel software vulnerabilities, which I’ll describe later in the
chapter on API Attacks. But here are a few ideas for keen grad students who
want to have a go at the hardware:
[Word Count: 57]

The straightforward approach would be to devise some way to erode the
protective potting, detect mesh lines, and connect shunts round them. A
magnetic force microscope might be worth a try.
[Word Count: 31]

One could invent a means of drilling holes eight millimeters long and
only 0.1 millimeters wide (that is, much less than the mesh line diame-
ter). This isn’t straightforward with standard mechanical drills, and the
same holds for laser ablation and ion milling. However I speculate that
some combination of nanotechnology and ideas from the oil industry
might make such a drill possible eventually. Then one could drill right
through the protective mesh with a fair probability of not breaking the
circuit.
[Word Count: 82]

Having dismantled a few instances of the device and understood its
hardware, the attacker might attempt to destroy the tamper responding
circuitry before it has time to react. One possibility is to use an
industrial X-ray machine; another would be to use shaped explosive
charges to send plasma jets of the kind discussed in section 13.5 into the
device.

before I go on to discuss cheaper devices.
The IBM paper which describes the design of the 4753 [6] proposed the
following classiﬁcation of attackers, which has been widely used since:
[Word Count: 43]

1. Class 1 attackers — ‘clever outsiders’ — are often very intelligent but
may have insufﬁcient knowledge of the system. They may have access to
only moderately sophisticated equipment. They often try to take advan-
tage of an existing weakness in the system, rather than try to create one.
[Word Count: 49]

2. Class 2 attackers — ‘knowledgeable insiders’ — have substantial spe-
cialized technical education and experience. They have varying degrees
of understanding of parts of the system but potential access to most of it.
They often have highly sophisticated tools and instruments for analysis.
[Word Count: 44]

3. Class 3 attackers — ‘funded organizations’ — are able to assemble teams
of specialists with related and complementary skills backed by great
funding resources. They are capable of in-depth analysis of the system,
designing sophisticated attacks, and using the most advanced analysis
tools. They may use Class 2 adversaries as part of the attack team.

Good examples of ‘level 3.5’ products are the iButton and 5002 security
processors from Dallas Semiconductor, and the Capstone chip used to protect
U.S. military communications up to ‘Secret’. While the 4758 costs $2000, these
products cost of the order of $10–20. Yet mounting an attack on them is far
from trivial.

FPGA Security, and the Clipper Chip
[Word Count: 7]

With antifuse FPGAs, it’s sometimes possible to abuse the programming
circuit. This circuit is designed to send a pulse to melt the fuse, but stop
once the resistance drops, as this means the metal has melted and estab-
lished contact. If the pulse weren’t stopped then the metal might vapor-
ise and go open circuit again. So the programming circuit has sensors
to detect whether a fuse is open or short, and if these aren’t sufﬁciently
disabled after programming they can be used to read the bitstream out.

The brute-force approach is to determine the presence of blown anti-
fuses using optical or electron microscopy, for example by removing the
top metal layer of the chip and looking at the vias directly. This can be
extremely tedious, but brute force attacks have been done on some secu-
rity processors.

The two current windows of vulnerability are the memory and the rear
side. Static RAM cells are still fairly large; even with 0.13 micron process an
SRAM cell is about 1.2 by 1.7 microns and can thus be individually targeted,
whether for fault induction or for read-out of its contents. Rear-side optical
attacks use the fact that silicon is transparent at wavelengths greater than 1.1
microns, while rear-side probing attacks use FIBs with special equipment for
the purpose.

So although, at the silicon level, smartcards are usually much harder to
copy than magnetic stripe cards, the level of protection they give in an actual
application will depend critically on what products you select and how cleverly
you use them.
So what sort of strategies are available to you if you are designing a system
which depends on smartcards?
[Word Count: 60]

Whether you go for the defense-in-depth approach will often depend on
the extent to which you can limit the losses that result from a single card’s
being successfully probed. In early pay-TV systems, the system architecture
forced all customer cards to contain the same master secret. Once this secret
became known, pirate cards can be manufactured at will, and the card base
had to be replaced. The pay-TV systems currently being deployed for digital
broadcasting use crypto protocols in which cards have different keys, so that

Crosstalk between telephone wires was well known to the pioneers of tele-
phony in the 19th century, whose two-wire circuits were stacked on tiers
of crosstrees on supporting poles. One way of dealing with it was to use
‘transpositions’, in which the wires were crossed over at intervals to make the
circuit a twisted pair. This problem appears to have ﬁrst come to the attention
of the military during the British Army expedition to the Nile and Suakin in
1884–85 [923].

Technical Surveillance and Countermeasures
[Word Count: 5]

Before getting carried away with high-tech toys such as Tempest monitor-
ing receivers, we ought to stop and think about bugs. The simplest and
most widespread attacks that use the electromagnetic spectrum are not those
exploiting some unintended feature of innocuous equipment, but those in
which a custom-designed device is introduced by the attacker.
No matter how well it is protected by encryption and access controls while
in transit or storage, most highly conﬁdential information originally comes
[Word Count: 77]

17.3 Technical Surveillance and Countermeasures

[Word Count: 6]

into being either as speech or as keystrokes on a PC. If it can be captured by
the opponent at this stage, then no subsequent protective measures are likely
to help very much.
So an extraordinary range of bugs is available on the market:
[Word Count: 44]

At the low end, a few tens of dollars will buy a simple radio
microphone that you can stick under a table when visiting the target.
Battery life is the main constraint on these devices. They typically have
a range of only a few hundred yards, and a lifetime of days to weeks.
[Word Count: 53]

Many modern bugs use off-the-shelf mobile phone technology. They can
be seen as slightly modiﬁed cellphone handsets that go off-hook silently
when called. This gives them worldwide range; whether they last more
than a week or so depends on whether they can be connected to a power
source when installed.
[Word Count: 50]

Laser microphones work by shining a laser beam at a reﬂective or par-
tially reﬂective surface, such as a window pane, in the room where the
target conversation is taking place. The sound waves modulate the
reﬂected light, which can be picked up and decoded at a distance.
[Word Count: 48]

High-end devices used today by governments, which can cost upwards
of $10,000, use low-probability-of-intercept radio techniques such as fre-
quency hopping and burst transmission. They can also be turned on and
off remotely. These features can make them much harder to ﬁnd.
[Word Count: 42]

People constantly come up with creative new ideas. A recent one is the
jitterbug which you put in a keyboard cable. It modulates keystroke data,
such as passwords, into sub-perceptible keystroke delays. This means
that a password you type can be more easily guessed by an attacker who
wiretaps your connection, even if it’s encrypted [1155].
[Word Count: 56]

A number of countermeasures can give a fair degree of protection against
such attacks, provided they are used by skilled and experienced experts.

Breaking the line of sight, such as by planting trees around your labora-

The tension here is between technological defenses, which can be effective
but very expensive, and procedural controls, which are cheap but tedious.
All that said, technological developments are steadily making life easier for
the bugger and harder for the defense. As more and more devices acquire
intelligence and short-range radio or infrared communications — as ‘things
that think’ become ‘things that chatter’ — there is ever more scope for attacks
via equipment that’s already in place rather than stuff that needs to emplaced
for the purpose. For example:

The risks associated with telephones are much more than many people
would like to believe. More and more people use cordless phones for
convenience, and forget that they’re easy to eavesdrop. Phones can be
doctored so that they’ll go off-hook under remote control; some digital
phones have such a facility already built into them (and it’s said that
some countries make this a condition of import licensing). Also, some
makes of PBX can be reprogrammed to support this kind of surveillance.
[Word Count: 81]

The typical laptop computer has a microphone that can be switched on
under software control, and is increasingly likely to be online from time
to time. An attacker can infect it with malware that listens to conversa-
tions in the room, compresses them, encrypts them and mails them back
to its creator.

17.4.1
Leakage Through Power and Signal Cables
[Word Count: 7]

Since the nineteenth century, engineers have been aware that high-frequency
signals leak everywhere and that care is needed to stop them causing problems,
and, as I noted, the leakage has been exploited for military purposes since
1914. Conducted leakage of information can be largely suppressed by careful
design, with power supplies and signal cables suitably ﬁltered and suppressed.
This makes up a signiﬁcant part of the cost difference between otherwise
comparable military and civilian electronics.
[Word Count: 75]

and imposing strict enough conﬁguration management to preserve red/black
separation, can cost millions.

When I ﬁrst learned to program in 1972 at the Glasgow Schools’ Computer
Centre, we had an early IBM machine with a 1.5 MHz clock. A radio tuned to
this frequency in the machine room would emit a loud whistle, which varied
depending on the data being processed. This phenomenon was noted by many
people, some of whom used it as a debugging aid. A school colleague of mine
had a better idea: he wrote a set of subroutines of different lengths such that

is a logical ﬁrst step. We removed the top 30% of the Fourier transform of a
standard font by convolving it with a suitable low-pass ﬁlter (see Figures 17.3
and 17.4).

However, the difference in the emitted RF is dramatic, as illustrated in the
photographs in Figures 17.7 and 17.8. These show the potentially compromis-
ing emanations, as seen by a Tempest monitoring receiver.

While the level of protection which Soft Tempest techniques can provide
for VDUs is only of the order of 10–20 dB, this translates to a difference of a
zone — which in an organization the size of a government, can save a lot of
money [70].
[Word Count: 46]

There are other attacks that software tricks can block completely. For
example, computer keyboards can be snooped on while the microcontroller
goes through a loop that scans all the keys until it encounters one that is
pressed. The currently pressed key is modulated on to the RF emissions from
the keyboard. By encrypting the order in which the keys are scanned, this kind
of attack can be completely blocked.
[Word Count: 69]

However, it’s not enough to simply encrypt a keyboard scan pattern to protect
it, as the attacker can use active as well as passive techniques. Against a
keyboard, the technique is to irradiate the cable with a radio wave at its
resonant frequency. Thanks to the nonlinear junction effect, the keypress
codes are modulated into the return signal which is reradiated by the cable.
This can be picked up at a distance of 50–100 yards. To prevent it, one must
also encrypt the signal from the keyboard to the PC [753].
[Word Count: 91]

There are quite a few other active attacks possible on various systems. The
phenomenon that we observed with the IBM 1401 — that a suitable program
would cause a computer to play a tune on the radio, in effect turning it into
a low-grade radio transmitter — is easy enough to reimplement on a modern
PC. Figures 17.9 and 17.10 show what the screen on a PC looks like when the
video signal is an RF carrier at 2 MHz, modulated with pure tones of 300 and
1200 Hz.

Even where the attacker does not know the card’s software in detail, glitch
attacks can still be a knockout. Dan Boneh, Richard DeMillo and Richard
Lipton noticed that a number of public key cryptographic algorithms break
if a random error can be induced [206]. For example, when doing an RSA
signature the secret computation S = h(m)d (mod pq) is carried out mod p, then
mod q, and the results are then combined, as this is much faster. But if the
card returns a defective signature Sp which is correct modulo p but incorrect
modulo q, then we will have
[Word Count: 100]

Other attacks use a combination of active and passive methods. I mentioned
in passing in Part I a trick that could be used to ﬁnd the PIN in a stolen
[Word Count: 30]

Not all Emsec attacks involve covert military surveillance or lab attacks on
tamper-resistant devices. I already mentioned the TV detector vans used in
Britain to catch TV license defaulters, and the uproar over voting machines
in Holland. There are also marketing applications. U.S. venue operator SFX
Entertainment monitors what customers are playing on their car radios as they
drive into venue parking lots by picking up the stray RF from the radio’s local
oscillator. Although legal, this annoys privacy advocates [1212]. The same
equipment has been sold to car dealers, mall operators and radio stations.

Once people learn how to program them, they may well use them for Tempest
attacks.
Finally, Emsec issues are not entirely divorced from electronic warfare. As
society becomes more and more dependent on devices that are vulnerable to
strong radio frequency signals — such as the high power microwaves gener-
ated by military radars — so the temptation to mount attacks will increase. I’ll
discuss high energy radio frequency attacks in the next chapter but one.
[Word Count: 76]

Emission security covers a whole range of threats in which the security of sys-
tems can be subverted by compromising emanations, whether from implanted
bugs, from unintentional radio frequency or conducted electromagnetic leak-
age, to emanations that are induced in some way. Although originally a concern
in the national intelligence community, Emsec is now a real issue for compa-
nies that build security products such as smartcards and cash machines. Many
of these products can be defeated by observing stray RF or conducted signals.
Protecting against such threats isn’t as straightforward as it might seem.
[Word Count: 95]

We need a comprehensive set of emission security standards for commercial
use. The military standards — NATO SDIP-27 and USA NSTISSAM — are
classiﬁed, although they’ve leaked as described in section 17.4.2. RFI/EMC
standards — the civilian IEC/CISPR 22 and the stricter MIL-STD-461E — were
simply not designed to protect information. The recent panic in Holland about
Tempest snooping on voting machines shows that standards are needed, so
that equipment purchasers and vendors can take a view on whether they’re
needed in any given application.
[Word Count: 85]

One is happenstance; twice is coincidence; but three times is enemy action.
[Word Count: 12]

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
[Word Count: 5]

Many supposedly secure devices have some kind of application programming
interface, or API, that untrustworthy people and processes can call in order to
get some task performed.
[Word Count: 27]

A bank’s server will ask an attached hardware security module ‘Here’s
a customer account number and PIN, with the PIN encrypted using the

A secure operating system may limit the calls that an application pro-

a policy such as preventing information ﬂow from High to Low.
[Word Count: 35]

The natural question to ask is whether it’s safe to separate tasks into a
trusted component and a less trusted one, and it’s recently been realised that
the answer is very often no. Designing security APIs is a very hard problem
indeed.
[Word Count: 42]

We have learned a lot about API security from failures of the hardware
security modules used by banks to protect PINs and crypto keys for ATM
networks. In 1988, Longley and Rigby identiﬁed the importance of separating
key types while doing work for security module vendor Eracom [811]. In 1993,
[Word Count: 50]

18.2 API Attacks on Security Modules

[Word Count: 7]

we reported a security ﬂaw that arose from a custom transaction added to
a security module [69]. However the subject really got going in 2000 when
I started to think systematically about whether there might be a series of
transactions that one could call from a security module that would break its
security [52]. I asked: ‘So how can you be sure that there isn’t some chain of
17 transactions which will leak a clear key?’ Looking through the manuals, I
discovered the following vulnerability.
[Word Count: 85]

VSM −→printer: KMTi

It also had another transaction that will combine two such components to

Host −→VSM: {KMT1}KM, {KMT2}KM

[Word Count: 8]

The idea was that to generate a terminal key for the ﬁrst time, you’d use
the ﬁrst of these transactions twice followed by the second. Then you’d have
KMT = KMT1 exclusive-or KMT2. However, there was nothing to stop the
[Word Count: 40]

programmer taking any old encrypted key and supplying it twice in the
second transaction, resulting in a known terminal key (the key of all zeroes, as
the key is exclusive-or’ed with itself):

You’d have thought that after the initial batch of API attacks were published

demanded the addition of new transactions that add to the insecurity.

jobs in security engineering (I’ll come to this in Chapter 25). Combine this
with the fact that economic pressures push web applications toward unsafe
defaults, such as making everything searchable, and the strong likelihood that
not all third-party developers will be benevolent — and it should be clear that
we can expect problems.

Military communications were dominated by physical dispatch until about
1860, then by the telegraph until 1915, and then by the telephone until
recently [923]. Nowadays, a typical command and control structure is made
up of various tactical and strategic radio networks supporting data, voice and
images, operating over point-to-point links and broadcast. Without situational
awareness and the means to direct forces, the commander is likely to be
ineffective. But the need to secure communications is much more pervasive
than one might at ﬁrst realize, and the threats are much more diverse.
[Word Count: 91]

One obvious type of trafﬁc is the communications between ﬁxed sites
such as army headquarters and the political leadership. A signiﬁcant his-
torical threat here was that the cipher security might be penetrated and
the orders, situation reports and so on compromised, whether as a result
of cryptanalysis or — more likely — equipment sabotage, subversion of
personnel or theft of key material. The insertion of deceptive messages
may also be a threat in some circumstances. But cipher security will often
include protection against trafﬁc analysis (such as by link encryption) as
[Word Count: 92]

562
Chapter 19

[Word Count: 7]

well as of the transmitted message conﬁdentiality and authenticity. The
secondary threat is that the link might be disrupted, such as by destruc-
tion of cables or relay stations.
[Word Count: 29]

There are more stringent requirements for communications with covert
assets such as agents in the ﬁeld. Here, in addition to cipher security
issues, location security is important. The agent will have to take steps to
minimize the risk of being caught as a result of communications mon-
itoring. If he sends messages using a medium which the enemy can
monitor, such as the public telephone network or radio, then much of his
effort may go into frustrating trafﬁc analysis and radio direction ﬁnding.
[Word Count: 83]

Control and telemetry communications, such as signals sent from an
aircraft to a missile it has just launched, must be protected against jam-
ming and modiﬁcation. It would also be desirable if they could be covert
(so as not to trigger a target’s warning receiver) but that is in tension
with the power levels needed to defeat defensive jamming systems.
One solution is to make the communications adaptive — to start off in
a low-probability-of-intercept mode and ramp up the power if needed in
response to jamming.

MILSTAR is a U.S. satellite communications system with 1 degree beams
from a geostationary orbit (20 GHz down, 44 GHz up). The effect of the
narrow beam is that users can operate within three miles of the enemy
without being detected. Jam protection is from hopping: its channels hop
several thousand times a second in bands of 2 GHz.
[Word Count: 59]

A system designed to control MX missiles is described in [530] and gives
an example of extreme survivability engineering. To be able to withstand
a nuclear ﬁrst strike, the system had to withstand signiﬁcant levels of
node destruction, jamming and atmospheric noise. The design adopted
was a frequency hopper at 450 KHz with a dynamically reconﬁgurable
network. It was not in the end deployed.

French tactical radios have remote controls. The soldier can use the
handset a hundred yards from the radio. This means that attacks on the
high-power emitter don’t have to endanger the troops so much [348].
[Word Count: 35]

There are also some system level tricks, such as interference cancellation —
here the idea is to communicate in a band which you are jamming and whose
jamming waveform is known to your own radios, so they can cancel it out or
hop around it. This can make jamming harder for the enemy by forcing him
to spread his available power over a larger bandwidth, and can make signals
intelligence harder too [1074].

targeted bombmakers in Ireland and Lebanon respectively). Better armor at
least is having some effect: while in 2003 almost every IED caused a coalition
casualty, now it takes four devices on average [94]. Armored vehicles were also
a key tactic in other insurgencies. Network disruption, though, is a longer-term

The strategist . . . should employ (the information weapon) as a
precursor weapon to blind the enemy prior to conventional attacks
and operations.
[Word Count: 24]

Meanwhile, the more aggressive view is that properly conducted infor-
mation operations should encompass everything from signals intelligence to
propaganda, and given the reliance that modern societies place on information,
it should sufﬁce to break the enemy’s will without ﬁghting.
[Word Count: 40]

In fact, there are roughly three views on what information warfare means:
[Word Count: 12]

that it is just ‘a remarketing of the stuff that the agencies have been doing
for decades anyway’, in an attempt to maintain the agencies’ budgets
post-Cold-War;
[Word Count: 27]

that it consists of the use of ‘hacking’ in a broad sense — network attack
tools, computer viruses and so on — in conﬂict between states or sub-
state groups, in order to deny critical military and other services whether
for operational or propaganda purposes. It is observed, for example, that
the Internet was designed to withstand thermonuclear bombardment,
but was knocked out by the Morris worm;
[Word Count: 67]

588
Chapter 19
■Electronic and Information Warfare
[Word Count: 7]

that it extends the electronic warfare doctrine of controlling the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum to control all information relevant to the conﬂict.
It thus extends traditional e-war techniques such as radar jammers by
adding assorted hacking techniques, but also incorporates propaganda
and news management.
[Word Count: 43]

warfare community can paint it as undermining the posture of information
dominance that a country must project in order to deter aggression.
So there is a fair amount of debunking to be done before the political and
military leadership can start to think clearly about the issues. For example,
it’s often stated that information warfare provides a casualty-free way to win
wars: ‘just hack the Iranian power grid and watch them sue for peace’. The
three obvious comments are as follows.
[Word Count: 81]

The denial-of-service attacks that have so far been conducted on infor-
mation systems without the use of physical force have mostly had a tran-
sient effect. A computer comes down; the operators ﬁnd out what hap-
pened; they restore the system from backup and restart it. An outage of a
few hours may be enough to let a bomber aircraft get through unscathed,
but is unlikely to bring a country to its knees. In this context, the failure
of the Millennium Bug to cause the expected damage may be a useful
warning.
[Word Count: 92]

Insofar as there is a vulnerability, more developed countries are more
exposed. The power grid in the USA or the UK is likely to be much more
computerized than that in a developing country.
[Word Count: 34]

Finally, if such an attack causes the deaths of several dozen people in
hospitals, the Iranians aren’t likely to see the matter as being much dif-
ferent from a conventional military attack that killed the same number
of people. Indeed, if information war targets civilians to an even greater
extent than the alternatives, then the attackers’ leaders are likely to be
portrayed as war criminals. The Pinochet case, in which a former head
of government only escaped extradition on health grounds, should give
pause for thought.
[Word Count: 86]

Having made these points, I will restrict discussion in the rest of this section
to technical matters.

Potentially Useful Lessons from Electronic

to become productive once the ﬁghting starts. Turf ﬁghts also get in the
way: under current U.S. rules, the air force can decide to bomb an enemy
telephone exchange but has to get permission from the NSA and/or CIA to
hack it [103]. The U.S. Army’s communications strategy is now taking account
of the need to communicate across the traditional command hierarchy, and to
make extensive use of the existing civilian infrastructure [1115].
At the technical level, there are many concepts which may go across from
electronic warfare to information protection in general.
[Word Count: 93]

The electronic warfare community uses guard band receivers to detect
jamming, so it can be ﬁltered out (for example, by blanking receivers at
the precise time a sweep jammer passes through their frequency). The
use of bait addresses to detect spam is essentially the same concept.
[Word Count: 46]

There is also an analogy between virus recognition and radar signal
recognition. Virus writers may make their code polymorphic, in that it
changes its form as it propagates, in order to make life harder for the
virus scanner vendors; similarly, radar designers use very diverse wave-
forms in order to make it harder to store enough of the waveform in
digital radio frequency memory to do coherent jamming effectively.
[Word Count: 69]

Our old friends, the false accept and false reject rate, continue to dom-
inate tactics and strategy. As with burglar alarms or radar jamming,
the ability to cause many false alarms (however crudely) will always
be worth something: as soon as the false alarm rate exceeds about 15%,
operator performance is degraded. As for ﬁltering, it can usually be
cheated.
[Word Count: 60]

The limiting economic factor in both attack and defense will increasingly
be the software cost, and the speed with which new tools can be created
and deployed.
[Word Count: 27]

Although defense in depth is in general a good idea, you have to be
careful of interactions between the different defenses. The classic case
in e-war is when chaff dispensed to defend against an incoming cruise
missile knocks out the anti-aircraft gun. The side-effects of defenses can
also be exploited. The most common case on the net is the mail bomb in
[Word Count: 62]

which an attacker forges offensive newsgroup messages that appear to
come from the victim, who then gets subjected to a barrage of abuse and
attacks.
[Word Count: 25]

Finally, some perspective can be drawn from the differing roles of hard
kill and soft kill in electronic warfare. Jamming and other soft-kill attacks
are cheaper, can be used against multiple threats, and have reduced
political consequences. But damage assessment is hard, and you may just
divert the weapon to another target. As most information war is soft-kill,
these comments can be expected to go across too.
[Word Count: 67]

19.8.4
Differences Between E-war and I-war
[Word Count: 6]

As well as similarities, there are differences between traditional electronic
warfare and the kinds of attack that can potentially be run over the net.
[Word Count: 24]

There are roughly two kinds of war — open war and guerilla war. Elec-
tronic warfare comes into its own in the ﬁrst of these: in air combat,
most naval engagements, and the desert. In forests, mountains and cities,
the man with the AK47 can still get a result against mechanized forces.
Guerilla war has largely been ignored by the e-war community, except
insofar as they make and sell radars to detect snipers and concealed mor-
tar batteries.
[Word Count: 78]

In cyberspace, the ‘forests, mountains and cities’ are the large numbers
of insecure hosts belonging to friendly or neutral civilians and organi-
zations. The distributed denial of service attack, in which millions of
innocent machines are subverted and used to bombard a target website
with trafﬁc, has no real analogue in the world of electronic warfare: yet it
is the likely platform for launching attacks even on ‘open’ targets such as
large commercial web sites. So it’s unclear where the open countryside in
cyberspace actually is.
[Word Count: 86]

Another possible source of asymmetric advantage for the guerilla is
complexity. Large countries have many incompatible systems, which
makes little difference when ﬁghting another large country with simi-
larly incompatible systems, but can leave them at a disadvantage to a
small group with simple coherent systems.
[Word Count: 46]

Anyone trying to attack the USA in future is unlikely to repeat Saddam
Hussein’s mistake of taking on the West in a tank battle. Asymmetric
conﬂict is now the norm, and although cyberspace has some potential
here, physical attacks have so far got much more traction — whether at
the Al-Qaida level of murderous attacks, or at the lower level of (say)
animal rights activists, who set out to harass people rather than mur-
der them and thus stay just below the threshold at which a drastic state
[Word Count: 88]

592
Chapter 19
■Electronic and Information Warfare
[Word Count: 7]

response would be invoked. A group that wants to stay at this level — so
that its operatives risk short prison sentences rather than execution —
can have more impact if it uses physical as well as electronic harassment.
[Word Count: 39]

As a member of Cambridge University’s governing body, the Council,
I was subjected for some months to this kind of hassle, as animal rights
fanatics protested at our psychology department’s plans to construct
a new building to house its monkeys. I also watched the harassment’s
effects on colleagues. Spam ﬂoods were easily enough dealt with; peo-
ple got much more upset when protesters woke them and their families
in the small hours, by throwing rocks on their house roofs and screaming
abuse. I’ll discuss this later in Part III.
[Word Count: 89]

There is no electronic-warfare analogue of script kiddies — people who
download attack scripts and launch them without really understand-
ing how they work. That such tools are available universally, and for
free, has few analogues in meatspace. You might draw a comparison
with the lawless areas of countries such as Afghanistan where all men go
about armed. But the damage done by Russian script kiddies to Estonia
was nothing like the damage done to allied troops by Afghan tribes-
men — whether in the present Afghan war or in its nineteenth century
predecessors.
[Word Count: 94]

Electronic warfare is much more developed than most other areas of informa-
tion security. There are many lessons to be learned, from the technical level up
through the tactical level to matters of planning and strategy. We can expect
that if information warfare takes off, and turns from a fashionable concept
into established doctrine and practice, these lessons will become important for
engineers.
[Word Count: 63]

An interesting research problem is how to port techniques and experience
from the world of electronic warfare to the Internet. This chapter is only a
sketchy ﬁrst attempt at setting down the possible parallels and differences.
[Word Count: 36]

I rarely had to resort to a technical attack. Companies can spend
millions of dollars toward technological protections and that’s
wasted if somebody can basically call someone on the telephone and
either convince them to do something on the computer that lowers
the computer’s defenses or reveals the information they were seeking.
[Word Count: 52]

There are two kinds of fools. One says, ‘‘This is old, therefore it is
good.’’ The other one says, ‘‘This is new, therefore it is better’’.
[Word Count: 26]

Early metering systems were wide open to abuse.
[Word Count: 8]

In the 1950’s, the operator in some systems had to listen for the sound of
coins dropping on a metal plate to tell that a callbox customer had paid,
[Word Count: 29]

so some people acquired the knack of hitting the coinbox with a piece of
metal that struck the right note.
[Word Count: 20]

Early systems also signalled the entry of a coin by one or more pulses,
each of which consisted of the insertion of a resistance in the line fol-
lowed by a brief open circuit. At a number of colleges, enterprising stu-
dents installed ‘magic buttons’ which could simulate this in a callbox in
the student union so people could phone for free. (The bill in this case
went to the student union, for which the magic button was not quite so
amusing.)
[Word Count: 82]

The term ‘phone phreaking’ refers to attacks on signaling as well as pure toll
fraud. Until the 1980s, phone companies used signalling systems that worked
in-band by sending tone pulses in the same circuit that carried the speech. The

you’ve hung up. The telephone exchange ignores this signal, so you remain
on the phone but with the police recording stopped [1151].

enforcement add-ons — different techniques are needed.

More and more cases of telephone manipulation involve feature interaction.
[Word Count: 10]

A number of directory-enquiry services will connect you to the num-
ber they’ve just given you, as a service to motorists who can’t dial while
driving. But this can often be used to defeat mechanisms that depend on
endpoint identiﬁcation. Adulterers use it to prevent their spouses seeing
lovers’ numbers on the family phone bill, and naughty children use it to
call sex lines despite call barring [977].
[Word Count: 68]

British Telecom launched a feature called ‘Ringback’. If you dial an
engaged number, you can then enter a short code and as soon as the
called number is free, both your phone and theirs will ring. The result-
ing call is billed to you. However, when you used ringback used from a
pay phone, it was the phone’s owner who ended up with the bill. Peo-
ple with private pay phones, such as pub landlords and shopkeepers,
lost a lot of money, which the phone company was eventually obliged to
refund [652].
[Word Count: 92]

This brings us to the many problems with mobile phones.
[Word Count: 10]

1. there may be a personal identiﬁcation number that you use to unlock the
card. In theory, this stops stolen mobiles being used. In practice, many
networks set an initial PIN of 0000, and most users never change it or
even use it;
[Word Count: 43]

2. there’s an international mobile subscriber identiﬁcation (IMSI), a unique
number that maps on to your mobile phone number;
[Word Count: 19]

3. ﬁnally there is a subscriber authentication key Ki, a 128-bit number that
serves to authenticate that IMSI and is known to your home network.
[Word Count: 25]

The relationship between these values is that RAND, encrypted under the
SIM’s authentication key Ki, gives an output which is SRES concatenated
with Kc:
[Word Count: 24]

Figure 20.1: GSM authentication system components
[Word Count: 6]

Anyway, the triplets are sent to the base station, which now presents
the ﬁrst RAND to the mobile. It passes this to the SIM, which computes SRES.
The mobile returns this to the base station and if it’s correct the mobile and the
base station can now communicate using the ciphering key Kc. So the whole
authentication protocol runs as in Figure 20.2.

1The equipment can encrypt trafﬁc, but the average phone company has no incentive to switch
the cryptography on. Indeed, as intelligence agencies often monitor the backhaul near major
switching nodes as an efﬁcient means of getting warrantless access to trafﬁc, a phone company
that did switch on the crypto might ﬁnd that persons unknown started jamming the link to make
them stop.
[Word Count: 62]

2There are also completely fake kidnappings in which the bad guys just lie: they say they’ve
snatched the child, and if they call its phone it will be killed. The perpetrators of these crimes
are often in prison and have little to lose. 20% of parents still pay up rather than take the

Phone companies are classic examples of a business with extremely high
ﬁxed costs and very low marginal costs. Building a nationwide network costs
billions and yet the cost of handling an additional phone call is essentially zero.
As I discussed in Chapter 7 on Economics, this has a couple of implications.
First, there’s a tendency towards dominant-ﬁrm markets in which the
winner takes all. Indeed for many years telephone service was considered in

The phone companies also want to be able to charge for relatively high-
value product and service delivery, extending the current premium ser-
vices through location-based services (‘give me a map showing me how
to drive to the nearest McDonalds’) to music and video downloads and
extra services such as the Finnish ferry tickets, cans of coke from vending
machines, and (most recently) parking meters in London. The account-
ing system will have to become a lot more robust, and dispute resolu-
tion mechanisms fairer and more transparent, if this potential is to be
realised.
[Word Count: 95]

All this interacts with platform security. If malware becomes widespread
on mobile phones, then the botnet herders who control subverted phones
will be able to pay for all sorts of goods and services by getting infected
machines to send text messages. Recent history suggests that any exploits
that can be industrialised to make money on a large scale, will be.

Relatively little research is done outside phone company and intelligence

There is growing interest in trafﬁc analysis, which I’ll discuss later; and in
the likely effects of next-generation value added services, which are bound to
introduce new feature interactions and other vulnerabilities. The interaction
between all communications (especially mobile), platform security, and the
mechanisms used to protect distributed systems security, also looks like fertile
ground for both interesting research and expensive engineering errors. Society

So far we’ve seen a large number of attacks against individual computers and
other devices. But attacks increasingly depend on connectivity. Consider the
following examples.
[Word Count: 25]

1. An ofﬁce worker clicks on an attachment in email. This infects her PC
with malware that compromises other machines in her ofﬁce by snoop-
ing passwords that travel across the LAN.
[Word Count: 32]

2. The reason she clicked on the attachment is that the email came from her
mother. The malware had infected her mother’s machine and then sent
out a copy of a recent email, with itself attached, to everyone in mum’s
address book.
[Word Count: 42]

3. Her mother in turn got infected by an old friend who chose a common
password for his ISP account. When there are many machines on a net-
work, the bad guys don’t have to be choosy; rather than trying to guess
the password for a particular account, they just try one password over
and over for millions of accounts. Given a webmail account, they can
send out bad email to the whole contact list.

4. Another attack technique that makes sense only in a network context is
Google hacking. Here, the bad guys use search engines to ﬁnd web servers
that are running vulnerable applications.
[Word Count: 31]

6. One of the applications is fast-ﬂux. This changes the IP address of a
web site perhaps once every 20 minutes, so that it’s much more
difﬁcult to take down. A different machine in the botnet acts as the host
(or as a proxy to the real host) with each change of IP address, so
blocking such an address has at most a temporary effect. Fast-ﬂux
hosting is used by the better phishing gangs for their bogus bank
websites.

Suppose the attacker controls one of your PCs. Perhaps one of your employees
was careless; or maybe he’s gone bad, and wants to take over an account in
someone else’s name to defraud you, or to do some other bad thing such as
downloading child porn in the hope of framing someone. There are several
possibilities open to him.
[Word Count: 59]

1. He can install packet sniffer software to harvest passwords, get the root
password, and thus take over a suitable account. Password-snifﬁng
attacks can be blocked if you use challenge-response password gener-
ators, or a protocol such as Kerberos or ssh to ensure that clear text pass-
words don’t go over the LAN. I described Kerberos in Chapter 3, and I’ll
describe SSH later.
[Word Count: 64]

2. Another approach is to masquerade as a machine where the target
user — say the sysadmin — has already logged on. It is often possi-
ble for the attacker simply to set his MAC address and IP address to
those of the target. In theory, the target machine should send ‘reset’
packets when it sees trafﬁc to its IP address that’s not in response to its
own packets; but many machines nowadays have personal ﬁrewalls,
which throw away ‘suspicious’ packets. As a result, the alarm doesn’t
get raised [300].

Attacks Using Internet Protocols
and Mechanisms
[Word Count: 7]

Moving up now to the Internet protocol suite, the basic problem is similar:
there is no real authenticity protection in the default mechanisms. This is
particularly manifest at the lower level TCP/IP protocols, and has given rise
to many attacks.
Consider for example the 3-way handshake used by Alice to initiate a TCP
connection to Bob and set up sequence numbers.
This protocol can be exploited in a surprising number of different ways.
Now that service denial is becoming really important, let’s start off with the
simplest service denial attack: the SYN ﬂood.

of a packet to specify not just its destination but the route that it should take.
This made attacks too easy: you’d just send a packet from A to B to C to B to
C and so on, before going to its ﬁnal destination. Most ISPs now throw away
all packets with source routing set. (There was an alarm in early 2007 when it
turned out that source routing had found its way back into the speciﬁcation
for IPv6, but that’s now been ﬁxed [417].)

There’s a rising tide of DDoS attacks that happen by accident rather than
as a result of malice. For example, in 2003 the University of Wisconsin-
Madison found itself receiving hundreds of thousands of packets per
second requesting the time. It turned out that Netgear had sold some
700,000 routers that were hard-coded to ask their time server what time

Netgear ended up paying the university to maintain a high-bandwidth
time server for them. There have been dozens of similar incidents [303].

There’s a steady stream of DDoS attacks by spammers and phishermen
on the websites of organisations that try to hinder their activities, such as
Artists Against 419 and Spamhaus.
[Word Count: 29]

Even if we never see the Internet taken down by a monster botnet,
attacks can still be carried out on smaller targets. Prior to the Estonia
incident, there had been a DDoS attack on the servers of an opposition
party in Kyrgyzstan, and these followed the site when it was relocated
to North America [1081]. Certainly, DDoS puts a weapon in the hands
of gangsters that can be rented out to various unsavoury people.
[Word Count: 74]

That said, one mustn’t forget online activism. If a hundred thousand
people send email to the White House protesting against some policy
or other, is this a DDoS attack? Protesters should not be treated as felons;

In defending against network attack, there are broadly speaking four sets of
available tools.
[Word Count: 14]

1. First is management — keeping your systems up-to-date and conﬁgured
in ways that will minimise the attack surface;
[Word Count: 19]

2. Next is ﬁltering — the use of ﬁrewalls to stop bad things like Trojans and
network exploits, and to detect signs of attack and compromise if any-
thing gets through;
[Word Count: 31]

3. Next is intrusion detection — having programs monitoring your net-
works and machines for signs of malicious behaviour;
[Word Count: 19]

4. Finally there’s encryption — protocols such as TLS and SSH that enable
you to protect speciﬁc parts of the network against particular attacks.

Many ﬁrms just buy a ﬁrewall because it’s on the tick-list of due-diligence

ﬁltering router, which won’t need much maintanence and won’t get in the
way. Where security’s taken seriously, one possible approach is to invest in a
really serious ﬁrewall system, which might consist of a packet ﬁlter connecting
the outside world to a screened subnet, also known as a demilitarized zone

It’s a good idea to assume that attacks will happen, and it’s often cheaper to
prevent some attacks and detect the rest than it is to try to prevent everything.
The systems used to detect bad things happening are referred to generically as
intrusion detection systems. The antivirus software products I discussed earlier
are one example; but the term is most usually applied to boxes that sit on
your network and look for signs of an attack in progress or a compromised
machine [1100]. Examples include:
[Word Count: 86]

spam coming from a machine in your network;
[Word Count: 8]

packets with forged source addresses — such as packets that claim to
be from outside a subnet coming from it, or packets that claim to be from
inside arriving at it;

that’s being used to control a botnet.

21.4.4
Speciﬁc Problems Detecting Network Attacks
[Word Count: 6]

Turning now to the speciﬁc problem of detecting network intrusion, the
problem is much harder than (say) detecting mobile phone cloning for a
number of reasons. Network intrusion detection products still don’t work
very well, with both high missed alarm and false alarm rates. It’s common not
to detect actual intrusions until afterwards — although once one is detected
by other means, the traces can be found on the logs.
The reasons for the poor performance include the following, in no particular
order.
[Word Count: 83]

The Internet is a very noisy environment — not just at the level of con-
tent but also at the packet level. A large amount of random crud arrives
at any substantial site, and enough of it can be interpreted as hostile to
provide a signiﬁcant false alarm rate. A survey by Bellovin [149] reports
that many bad packets result from software bugs; others are the fault
of out-of-date or corrupt DNS data; and some are local packets that
escaped, travelled the world and returned.
[Word Count: 85]

There are ‘too few attacks’. If there are ten real attacks per million
sessions — which is almost certainly an overestimate — then even if
the system has a false alarm rate as low as 0.1%, the ratio of false to
real alarms will be 100. We talked about similar problems with burglar
alarms; it’s also a well known problem for medics running screening
programs for diseases like HIV where the test error exceeds the organ-
ism’s prevalence. In general, where the signal is far below the noise, the
guards get tired and even the genuine alarms get missed.
[Word Count: 99]

Many network attacks are speciﬁc to particular versions of software, so a
general misuse detection tool must have a large and constantly changing
library of attack signatures.
[Word Count: 27]

In many cases, commercial organisations appear to buy intrusion
detection systems simply in order to tick a ‘due diligence’ box to satisfy
insurers or consultants. That means the products aren’t always kept up
to date.
[Word Count: 35]

Encrypted trafﬁc can’t easily be subjected to content analysis any more
than it can be ﬁltered for malicious code.
[Word Count: 19]

The issues we discussed in the context of ﬁrewalls largely apply to intru-
sion detection too. You can ﬁlter at the packet layer, which is fast but
can be defeated by packet fragmentation; or you can reconstruct each
session, which takes more computation and so is not really suitable for
network backbones; or you can examine application data, which is more
expensive still — and needs to be constantly updated to cope with the
arrival of new applications and attacks.
[Word Count: 80]

You may have to do intrusion detection both locally and globally. The
antivirus side of things may have to be done on local machines, espe-
cially if the malware arrives on encrypted web sessions; on the other
hand, some attacks are stealthy — the opponent sends 1–2 packets per
day to each of maybe 100,000 hosts. Such attacks are unlikely to be found
by local monitoring; you need a central monitor that keeps histograms of
packets by source and destination address and by port.
[Word Count: 84]

So it appears unlikely that a single-product solution will do the trick. Future
intrusion detection systems are likely to involve the coordination of a number
of monitoring mechanisms at different levels both in the network (backbone,
LAN, individual machine) and in the protocol stack (packet, session and
application).
[Word Count: 48]

In the context of preventing network attacks, many people have been con-
ditioned to think of encryption. Encryption usually does a lot less than you
might hope, as the quote from Butler Lampson and Roger Needham at the
head of this chapter suggests. But it can sometimes be useful. Here I’m going
to describe brieﬂy the four most relevant network encryption scenarios: SSH;
the local link protection offered by WiFi, Bluetooth and HomePlug; IPSec; and
TLS. Finally I’ll brieﬂy discuss public key infrastructures (PKI), which are used
to support the last two of these.

the messages to date. The key for this MAC is the master-secret, K1. This
key is computed by hashing the pre-master-secret key with the nonces
sent by the client and server: K1 = h(K0, NC, NS). From this point onward,
all the trafﬁc is encrypted; we’ll write this as {...}KCS in the client-server
direction and {...}KSC from the server to the client. These keys are gener-
ated in turn by hashing the nonces with K1.

has also been available as an authentication option in Windows from Windows
2000 onwards; you can use it instead of Kerberos if you wish.
Another application is in mail, where more and more mail servers now use
TLS opportunistically when exchanging emails with another mail server that’s
also prepared to use it. This stops passive eavesdropping, although it leaves
open the possibility of middleperson attacks. To stop them too, you need some
means of authenticating the public keys you use, and that brings us to the
topic of public-key certiﬁcates.
[Word Count: 90]

Usability is dreadful, as many sites use out-of-date certs, or certs that
correspond to the wrong company. As a result, users are well trained
to ignore security warnings. For example, when a New Zealand bank

messed up its certiﬁcate with the result that users got warned it didn’t
correspond to the bank, only one user out of 300 stopped — the rest just
went ahead with their business [569].
[Word Count: 34]

Many users disable security features on their browsers, even if these
weren’t disabled by default when the software shipped. Recall that the
third step of the TLS protocol was for the client browser to check the
cert against its stored root certiﬁcates. If the check fails, the browser
may ask the client for permission to proceed; but many browsers are
conﬁgured to just proceed anyway.
[Word Count: 65]

Certs bind a company name to a DNS name, but their vendors are usu-
ally not authorities on either; they hand out certiﬁcates after cursory
due diligence, and in their ‘certiﬁcation practice statements’ they go
out of their way to deny all liability.
[Word Count: 43]

There are still technical shortcomings. For example, the dominant cer-
tiﬁcate format (X.509) does not have the kind of ﬂexible and scalable
‘hot card’ system which the credit card industry has evolved, but rather
assumes that anyone relying on a cert can download a certiﬁcate revo-
cation list from the issuing authority. Also, certs are designed to certify
names, when for most purposes one wants to certify an authorization.
[Word Count: 69]

Behind all this mess lies, as usual, security economics. During the dotcom
boom in the 1990s, the SSL protocol (as TLS then was) won out over a more
complex and heavyweight protocol called SET, because it placed less of a
burden on developers [72]. This is exactly the same reason that operating
systems such as Windows and Symbian were initially developed with too
little security — they were competing for pole position in a two-sided market.
[Word Count: 76]

The downside in this case was that the costs of compliance were dumped on
the users — who are unable to cope [357].
In short, while public key infrastructures can be useful in some applications,
they are not the universal solution to security problems that their advocates
claimed in the late 1990s. It’s a shame some governments still think they can
use PKI as a mechanism for empire-building and social control.

Unless you’re prepared to spend money on seriously tamper resistant
dongle hardware which executes some of your critical code, the mecha-

As processors got faster and code got more complex, operating system
interfaces became higher level, and software protection routines of the
‘bad disk sector’ variety became harder to write. And now that it’s possi-
ble to run a Windows NT system on top of Linux using VMware or Xen,
application software can be completely shielded from machine speciﬁcs
such as ethernet addresses. The net effect is an increase in the cost and
complexity of both protection and piracy.
[Word Count: 78]

Protection is a nuisance. Multiple dongles get in the way or even inter-
fere with each other. Software protection techniques tend to make a

product less robust and cause you problems — as when their hard disk
fails and they recover from backup to a new disk. Protection mecha-
nisms can also cause software from different vendors to be unnecessarily

that casual copying couldn’t be condoned so easily. Within a few years,

ers in any case, as non-standard operating system usage tended to set off

mon, mechanisms that made one or the other very much harder caused
problems. Mechanisms that could easily deal with both (such as dongles)

The evolution of early systems was determined largely by the hardware cost of
deciphering video (for a history of set-top boxes, see [293]). The ﬁrst generation
of systems, available since the 1970’s, were crude analog devices which used
[Word Count: 38]

tricks such as inverting the video signal from time to time, interfering with
the synchronization, and inserting spikes to confuse the TV’s automatic gain
control. They were easy enough to implement, but also easy to defeat; breaking
them didn’t involve cryptanalysis, just an oscilloscope and persistence.
The second generation of systems appeared in the late 1980’s and employed
a hybrid of analog and digital technologies: the broadcast was analogue, the
subscriber control was digital. These included systems such as Videocrypt and
Nagravision, and typically have three components:
[Word Count: 87]

a subscription management service at the station enciphers the outgo-
ing video, embeds various entitlement management messages (EMMs) and
entitlement control messages (ECMs) in it, and issues access tokens such as
smartcards to subscribers;
[Word Count: 34]

a set-top box converts the cable or satellite signal into one the TV can deal
with. This includes descrambling it;
[Word Count: 20]

programmes the set-top box is allowed to descramble. It does this by
interpreting the ECMs and providing keys to the descrambling circuit in
the set-top box.

Because of the limitations on the chips available at low cost in the early 1990s,
hybrid systems typically scramble video by applying a transposition cipher to
picture elements. A typical scheme was the cut-and-rotate algorithm used in

Videocrypt. This scrambles one line of video at a time by cutting it at a
point determined by a control byte and swapping the left and right halves

DVD does, so a standard disk will store 25 Gb and a double-layered one 50
Gb. Both of them use a content encryption system called AACS, while Blu-ray
adds an interesting extra mechanism called SPDC. (As I was correcting the

General Information Hiding Techniques
[Word Count: 5]

Many people have proposed hiding mark or secret message in the least
signiﬁcant bits of an audio or video signal. This isn’t usually a very good
strategy, as the hidden data is easy to detect statistically (the least sig-
niﬁcant bits are no longer correlated with the rest of the image), and it’s
trivial to remove or replace. It’s also severely damaged by lossy com-
pression techniques.
[Word Count: 67]

In the general case, one may want to embed more than one bit, and have
the embedded data to survive very high levels of induced errors. So a
common technique is to use direct-sequence spread-spectrum techniques
borrowed from electronic warfare [1251]. You have a number of secret
sequences, each coding a particular symbol, and you add one of them to
the content to mark it.
[Word Count: 65]

Spread spectrum encoding is often done in a transform space to make its
effects less perceptible and more robust against common forms of com-
pression. These techniques are also commonly used in conjunction with
perceptual ﬁltering, which emphasises the encoding in the noisiest or
[Word Count: 44]

perceptually most signiﬁcant parts of the image or music track, where it
will be least obtrusive, and de-emphasises it in quiet passages of music
or large expanses of color [208].
[Word Count: 30]

Some schemes use the characteristics of particular media, such as a
scheme for marking print media by moving text lines up or down by a
three-hundredth of an inch [221], or adding extra echoes to music below
the threshold of perception [160]. So far, such techniques don’t seem to
have become as robust, or as widely used, as generic techniques based
on keyed embedding using transform spaces, spread spectrum and per-
ceptual ﬁltering.
[Word Count: 73]

Progress in copyright marking and steganography was very rapid in the
late 1990s: people invented marking schemes which other people broke, until
eventually the technology became more mature and robust.

22.4.3
Attacks on Copyright Marking Schemes
[Word Count: 6]

Throughout this book, we’ve seen attacks on cryptographic systems that occa-
sionally involved cryptanalysis but more often relied on mistaken assumptions,
protecting the wrong things, protocol failures and implementation bugs. And
in the history of technology as a whole, inventions tend to end up being used
to solve problems somewhat different from the problems the inventor was
originally thinking about. Copyright marking has been no different on either
count.
[Word Count: 69]

In the beginning, many people assumed that the main market would
be embedding hidden copyright messages so that ownership of a work
could be proved in court. This was mistaken. Intellectual property
lawyers almost never have any difﬁculty in proving ownership of an
exhibit; they don’t rely on technical measures which might confuse a
jury, but on documents such as contracts with bands and model release
forms.
[Word Count: 67]

Some neat steganalysis techniques were developed to break particular
embedding schemes. For example, where the mark was added by either
increasing or decreasing the luminosity of the image by a small ﬁxed
amount, the caused the peaks in the luminosity graph to become twin
peaks, which meant that the mark could be ﬁltered out over much of
many images [826].

clear how to design marking schemes that will resist a chosen distor-
tion attack in which the attacker who understands the marking scheme
mangles the content in such a way as to cause maximum damage to
the mark while doing minimal damage to the marked content.
[Word Count: 46]

For a fuller account of attacks on copyright marking schemes, see [1019,
1020]. The technology’s improving slowly but the limiting factor appears to be
the difﬁculty of designing marking schemes that remain robust once the mark
detection algorithm is known. If any copy control scheme based on marking
is implemented in PC software or low-cost tamper-resistant processors, it’s
only a matter of time before the algorithm gets out; then expect to see people
writing quite effective unmarking software.

The answer depends on how competitive the markets are. Take the

the market for printers is competitive, competition will push down
the price of printers to compensate for the high-priced cartridges.
Restricting after-purchase use makes the monopoly in cartridges
stronger (since it inhibits reﬁlls), but that just makes sellers compete
more intensely to sell printers, leading to lower prices in that

First, there’s unauthorized access to data. When a ﬁrm with tens of thou-

basically the issues I discussed in Chapter 9, although on a much larger
scale than ever before.

Second, there’s privacy law. For example, the European Commission is
in dispute about how long clickstream data should be kept: Google’s

released anonymised search histories for ‘research’, and some users were
promptly identiﬁed from their search patterns; from the technical point

Skype.

2. In the case of your daughter Betty, all the evidence is that parental con-
cerns over the Internet are grossly over-inﬂated. Rather than trying to
get her to surf the net using Tor (which she’d just consider to be creepy
if her friends don’t use it too), you’d be better to make scams, phishing
and other abuses into a regular but not obsessive topic of conversa-
tion round the dinner table. (Once she gets the conﬁdence to join in the
conversation, she may turn out to have better tales than you do.)

3. The corporate engineer, Charles, may ﬁnd his main risk is that if he posts
from a work machine, then even if he’s using a throwaway webmail
address, he might inadvertently include material in documents such as
local printer or workgroup names or a camera serial number that the
corporate security guy then ﬁnds on Google. The simplest solution is to
use home equipment that isn’t cross-contaminated with work material.
Essentially this is a multilevel policy of the sort discussed in Chapter 8.

4. The human-rights activist Dai has one of the hardest jobs of all, but as
she’s being regularly shaken down by the police and is in contact with
a network of other activists with whom she can share experiences, she
at least has an opportunity to evolve good tradecraft over time.

5. The M&A analyst Elizabeth may well ﬁnd that Tor does pretty well
what she needs. Her main problem will be using it properly (even I once

expert).

bination of cryptographic hiding, camouﬂage and deception may save

be located; nowadays many customers come in via DSL, and providers use

My own experience is that developers with a clean, expressive set of speciﬁc security
requirements can build a very tight machine. They don’t have to be security gurus,
but they have to understand what they’re trying to build and how it should work.

One of the most important problems we face today, as techniques and systems
become more and more pervasive, is the risk of missing that ﬁne, human point that
may well make the difference between success and failure, fair and unfair, right and
wrong . . . no IBM computer has an education in the humanities.

My thumbnail case history to illustrate this point concerns three supermarkets.
Among the large operational costs of running a retail chain are the salaries of
the checkout and security staff, and the stock shrinkage due to theft. Checkout
queues aggravate your customers, so cutting staff isn’t always an option, and
working them harder might mean more shrinkage. So what might technology
do to help?

Software projects usually take longer than planned, cost more than budgeted
for and have more bugs than expected. (This is sometimes known as ‘Cheops’
law’ after the builder of the Great Pyramid.) By the 1960s, this had become
known as the software crisis, although the word ‘crisis’ is hardly appropriate
[Word Count: 50]

for a state of affairs that has now lasted (like computer insecurity) for two
generations. Anyway, the term software engineering was proposed by Brian
Randall in 1968 and deﬁned to be:

2The Waterfall Model had a precursor in a methodology developed by Gerhard Pahl and
Wolfgang Beitz in Germany just after World War 2 for the design and construction of mechanical
equipment such as machine tools [1001]; apparently one of Pahl’s students later recounted that it
was originally designed as a means of getting the engineering student started, rather than as an
accurate description of what experienced designers actually do. Win Royce also saw his model
as a means of starting to get order out of chaos, rather than as a totally prescriptive system it
developed into.

Critical computer systems can be deﬁned as those in which a certain class
of failure is to be avoided if at all possible. Depending on the class of
failure, they may be safety-critical, business-critical, security-critical, critical to
the environment or whatever. Obvious examples of the safety-critical variety
include ﬂight controls and automatic braking systems. There is a large literature

Once as many hazards have been eliminated as possible, the next step is to
identify failures that could cause accidents. A common top-down way of iden-
tifying the things that can go wrong is fault tree analysis as a tree is constructed
whose root is the undesired behavior and whose successive nodes are its pos-
sible causes. This carries over in a fairly obvious way to security engineering,
and here’s an example of a fault tree (or threat tree, as it’s often called in security
engineering) for fraud from automatic teller machines (see Figure 25.4).

world of agriculture, this problem is tackled by community mechanisms, such
as getting the parish council set up a grazing control committee. One of the
challenges facing the world of computer security is to devise the appropriate
mix of technical and organizational mechanisms to achieve the same sort of
result that was already achieved by a tenth-century Saxon village, only on the
much larger and more diffuse scale of the Internet.

[Word Count: 7]

is indeed ﬁt for purpose; that it does indeed work (or that it did work at some
particular time in the past). The reason that evaluation is both necessary and
hard is that, often, one principal carries the cost of protection while another
carries the risk of failure. This creates an obvious tension, and third-party
evaluation schemes such as the Common Criteria are often used to make it
more transparent.
[Word Count: 70]

A good starting point is to look at the various principals’ motives, and as a
preliminary let’s consider the things of which we may need assurance. Right
at the start of this book, in Figure 1.1, I presented a framework for thinking
rationally about security engineering based on incentives, policy, mechanism
and assurance.
[Word Count: 53]

Incentives are critical, as we’ve seen time and again. If people don’t actu-
ally want to protect a system it’s hard to make them. They fall somewhat
outside the formal assurance process, but are the most critical part of
the environment within which the security policy has to be deﬁned.
[Word Count: 50]

Policy is often neglected, as we’ve seen: people often end up protect-
ing the wrong things, or protecting the right things in the wrong way.
Recall from Chapter 9, for example, how the use of the Bell-LaPadula
model in the healthcare environment caused more problems than it
solved. We spent much of Part II of the book exploring security policies
for different applications, and much of the previous chapter discussing
how you’d go about developing a policy for a new application.
[Word Count: 81]

Mechanisms have been in the news repeatedly. U.S. export controls on
crypto led to products like DVD being shipped with 40-bit keys that
were intrinsically vulnerable. Strength of mechanisms is independent
of policy, but can interact with it. For example, I remarked how the
[Word Count: 44]

difﬁculty of preventing probing attacks on smartcards led the indus-
try to protect other, relatively unimportant things such as the secrecy
of chip masks.
[Word Count: 24]

Assurance traditionally focussed on implementation, and was about
whether, given the agreed functionality and strength of mechanisms,
the product has been implemented correctly. As we’ve seen, most real-
life technical security failures are due to programming bugs — stack
overﬂows, race conditions and the like. Finding and ﬁxing them absorbs
most of the effort of the assurance community.

It can also be a combination, as when a step in an evolutionary development
is managed using project techniques and is tested as a feature before being
integrated and subjected to system level regression tests. Here, you also have
to ﬁnd ways of building feature tests into your regression test suite.
Nonetheless, it’s helpful to look ﬁrst at the project issues and then at the
evolutionary issues.
[Word Count: 67]

In practice, security testing usually comes down to reading the product
documentation, then reviewing the code, and then performing a number of
tests. (This is known as white-box testing, as opposed to black-box testing in
which the tester has the product but not the design documents or source code.)
The process is:
[Word Count: 52]

First look for any architectural ﬂaws. Does the system use guessable
or too-persistent session identiﬁers? Is there any way you can inject
code, for example by sneaking SQL through a webserver into a back-end
database? Is the security policy coherent, or are there gaps in between
the assumptions? Do these lead to gaps in between the mechanisms
where you can do wicked things?
[Word Count: 63]

Then look for implementation ﬂaws, such as stack overﬂows and inte-
ger overﬂows. This will usually involve not just looking at the code, but
using specialist tools such as fuzzers.
[Word Count: 30]

Then work down a list of less common ﬂaws, such as those described
in the various chapters of this book. If the product uses crypto, look for
weak keys (or keys set to constant values) and poor random-number
generators; if it has components with different trust assumptions, try
to manipulate the APIs between them, looking for race conditions and
other combinations of transactions that have evil effects.

C1: discretionary access control by groups of users. In effect, this is considered
to be equal to no protection.
[Word Count: 19]

C2: discretionary access control by single users; object reuse; audit. C2 cor-
responds to carefully conﬁgured commercial systems; for example, C2
evaluations were given to IBM mainframe operating systems, and to Win-
dows NT. (Both of these were conditional on a particular conﬁguration;
in NT’s case, for example, it was restricted to diskless workstations.)

B1:
mandatory access control — all objects carry security labels and the
security policy (which means Bell-LaPadula or a variant) is enforced
independently of user actions. Labelling is enforced for all input
information.

B2:
structured protection — as B1 but there must also be a formal model of
the security policy that has been proved consistent with security axioms.
Tools must be provided for system administration and conﬁguration
management. The TCB must be properly structured and its interface
clearly deﬁned. Covert channel analysis must be performed. A trusted
path must be provided from the user to the TCB. Severe testing, including
penetration testing, must be carried out.
[Word Count: 74]

B3:
security domains — as B2 but the TCB must be minimal, it must mediate
all access requests, it must be tamper-resistant, and it must withstand for-
mal analysis and testing. There must be real-time monitoring and alerting
mechanisms, and structured techniques must be used in implementation.

promoting a more competitive market. However, the incentive issues were not
properly thought through.
This change in the rules motivated the vendor to shop around for the
evaluation contractor who would give his product the easiest ride, whether by
asking fewer questions, charging less money, taking the least time, or all of the
above1. To be fair, the potential for this was realized, and schemes were set up
whereby contractors could obtain approval as a commercial licensed evaluation
facility (CLEF). The threat that a CLEF might have its license withdrawn was
supposed to offset the commercial pressures to cut corners.

3. The typical security researcher wants a responsible means of disclos-
ing his discoveries, so he can give the vendors a reasonable period of
time to ship a patch before he ships his conference paper; so he will typ-

which in turn will notify the vendor and publish the vulnerability after
45 days.

4. The intelligence agencies want to learn of vulnerabilities quickly, so
that they can be exploited until a patch is shipped. (Many CERTs are
funded by the agencies and have cleared personnel.)

traq which don’t impose a delay; this can force software vendors to
ship emergency patches out of the usual cycle.

unpatched vulnerabilities in that they can use their ﬁrewalls to ﬁlter
