Over the past couple of days, cybercriminals have launched yet another massive spam campaign, once again targeting U.K users. This time, they are impersonating Vodafone U.K, in an attempt to trick its customers into executing a bogus MMS attachment found in the malicious emails. Upon execution, the sample opens a backdoor on the affected hosts, allowing the cybercriminals behind the campaign complete access to the affected PC.

Sample detection rate for the malicious attachment: MD5: 3ce2b9522a476515737d07b877dae06e – detected by 36 out of 44 antivirus scanners as Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Andromeda.coh.
Upon execution, the sample creates %AllUsersProfile%svchost.exe on the host. It also creates a Registry Value – [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun] -> SunJavaUpdateSched = “%AllUsersProfile%svchost.exe” so that svchost.exe starts evert time Windows starts.
Webroot SecureAnywhere users are proactively protected from this threat.
