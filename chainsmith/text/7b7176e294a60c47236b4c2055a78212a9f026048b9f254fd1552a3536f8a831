Want to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)? You may want to skip the CVs/personally identifiable information soliciting campaign that I’m about to profile in this post, as you’d be involuntarily sharing your information with what looks like an intelligence gathering operation.

About NATO:
NATO is committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes. If diplomatic efforts fail, it has the military capacity needed to undertake crisis management operations. These are carried out under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty
and/or under a UN mandate, alone or in cooperation with other countries and international organizations.
NATO promotes democratic values and encourages consultation and cooperation on defence and security issues to build trust and,in the long run, prevent conflict.
NATO provides a unique opportunity for member and partner countries to consult and take decisions on security issues at all levels and in a variety of fields to promote stability and guarantee allied defence. We want to be sure that we can walk around freely in a safe and secure environment. Security in all areas of everyday life is key to our well-being, but it cannot be taken for granted.

Naturally, we did apply for a random position and not surprisingly, we got accepted immediately to join NATO. So where’s the catch? It’s the amount and type of sensitive, as well as personally identifiable information that a potential applicant would need to submit to further escalate his or her application.
For instance, the Employment Application Form requires details on the Security Clearance, Level and Expiration Date of the prospective employee, as well as details on whether or not an application has any civilian or military relatives, currently working for NATO. Furthermore, potential applicants would also need to provide detailed information on their whereabouts abroad, such as country, reason for visiting and the exact dates. Needless to say that someone’s looking for the very best in sensitive and personally identifiable information, from the socially engineered prospective employees.

Frank Pedersen indeed exists, and indeed works for NATO, meaning that someone did their homework before launching the email campaign.
