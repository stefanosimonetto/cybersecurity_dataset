A typical campaign attempting to trick users into installing Potentially Unwanted Software (PUA), would usually consist of a single social engineering vector, which on the majority of cases would represent something in the lines of a catchy “Play Now/Missing Video Plugin” type of advertisement. Not the one we’ll discuss in this blog post. Relying on deceptive “visual social engineering” practices, a popular French torrent portal is knowingly — the actual directory structure explicitly says /fakeplayer — enticing users into installing the BubbleDock/Downware/DownloadWare PUA. What kind of social engineering tactics is the portal relying on? Let’s find out.

Sample screenshot of the fake and localized to French “Missing Plugin” presented on the top of the page:

As you can see in the attached screenshot, the portal attempts to convince the user that he/she is missing a plugin required to display the content. Once users attempt to download it by clicking on the link, they’re automatically exposed to the executable hosted within One Install’s affiliate based type of revenue sharing platform.
Sample screenshots of the fake WebPlugin video window:

The second “visual social engineering” vector relies on the ubiquitous for such type of social engineering campaigns, “Install the WebPlayer plugin” type of fake flash content.
