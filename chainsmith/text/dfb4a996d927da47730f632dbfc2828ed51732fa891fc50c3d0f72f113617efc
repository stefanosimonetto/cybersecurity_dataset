Astaro Security Gateway Version 8.200 Released

Announced at CeBit earlier this year, Astaro Security Gateway V8.200 is now available. ASG 8.2 adds Application Control (aka. Layer-7 or "Next-Generation" Firewall) and Network Visiblity so that you see everything happening in your network and can make educated, reactive decisions about how your connection is used. There is also an Interactive Web Reporting Engine that lets you craft and mold reports; you can navigate through data until you have the answer you need, no more tirelessly looking through pre-arranged reports hoping you stumble across the right one! 3G/UMTS USB support, Search Engine "Safe Search" enforcement, weights for Internet Connection balancing, and a User agent for user-based security configuration have all been introduced as well, to name just a few. WebAdmin sees usability improvements, and there is a technical preview of our upcoming Log Management product. Taking advantage of new technology and methods, we have vastly improved throughput performance of ASG, increasing it by up to four times in some areas, with a focus on Intrusion Protection and Firewall throughput.

Network up2date

Announced at CeBit earlier this year, Astaro Security Gateway V8.200 is now available. ASG 8.2 adds Application  Control (aka. Layer-7 or "Next-Generation"  Firewall) and Network  Visiblity so that you see everything happening in  your network and  can make educated, reactive decisions about how your  connection is used.

For over 8 months our ASG Public Beta program has seen hundreds of  particpants making  over 5000 posts while you helped us shape and build  this version to solve the problems you face in the real-world. Dozens of  new features and functions have been  added or improved upon, and our  open approach to feedback and improvement  suggestions via our Feature Portal has evolved Astaro Security Gateway further than ever; it truly is a product of YOUR environment.
A summary of some new features and functionality follows below,   along with download information. For more details about Astaro Security   Gateway 8.2 you can view the full release notes here. We hope you enjoy this release as much as we enjoyed making it for you.
ASG 8.200 Feature Summary:

Application Control
ASG provides Application Control and Network Visibilty.  Application Control uses hundreds of precise patterns to identify which applications are being used on the network, regardless of the port or protocol they use to communicate. Network Visibility gives you a real-time display of exactly how your Internet connection is being used, and lets you create configuration directly from the display. We are pleased to included Application Control as part of our Web Security and Full Guard subscriptions. Read more >
Interactive Web Reporting
The Web Reporting Engine has been entirely re-designed from the ground-up to give a new, optimized experience which is tailored for how you expect to see data while delivering the information you are looking for easily. Click, build, save, and subscribe users and groups to automated report delivery in moments. You can even see exactly what your users are searching for with Google, Yahoo, and Bing. A staggering array of features awaits you. Read more >

*Note* – Installing ASG 8.200 will clear existing Web Security Reports! This is necessary as the database systems are vastly different. Soon, we will offer the ability to “re-inject” a past Web Security log file from 8.103 into the system so that you can control when this system-intensive task will occur.  (Log files are completely untouched and remain intact on the system as configured)
If you rely on existing Web Security reports, do NOT install ASG 8.200 until the re-inject feature has been released in a future Up2Date.

3G/UMTS USB Modem Support
ASG supports the use of 3G/UMTS USB modems (sticks). This feature allows for these cellular USB-connected devices to be used as an Internet interface. The support of these devices lets you add redundancy or connectivity at temporary sites, remote locations, or areas without a good selection of affordable Internet connections. Further, you can add 3G/UMTS connections to the ASG’s WAN (Internet) link balancing pool.
Astaro Authentication Agent
Provide per-user configuration using the new Astaro Authentication Agent (AAA). Users can now authenticate using this lightweight program that is used for identification to control access or assign permissions such as Web Security profiles, while gaining more detailed reporting for environments without dedicated authentication servers
Web Filtering Safe Search Enforcement

The Web Security system of ASG can now enforce the enabling of “Safe Searching” for the user at the three major search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing).
This feature will automatically enable the “safe search” features of these engines, which will filter their search queries and results no matter what the user sets for preferences in their browsers

Web Application Security: Form Hardening – Enforce the answers which can be given to forms you offer on your servers. Read more >
