The announcement of the test brought a few surprises, as several regulars opted to skip this one, but the majority of veteran competitors took part as usual, along with several newer faces, many of whom look set to join the ranks of our regulars.</p><p>A total of 25 products were expected to take part, however, due to technical difficulties one of our most reliable participants was unable to provide a product on the deadline date. While some vendors have produced dedicated x64 products, many continue to rely on their standard versions. This was expected to cause some difficulties, and after a setup period considerably shaken by a series of hardware disasters, the legacy of a temperature control failure a few weeks ago which continued to cause problems throughout the testing period, we could only hope to get through this month&rsquo;s test with a modicum of sanity intact.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3649348"></a>Platform and test sets</h2></div></div></div><p>Once again we visit the 64-bit edition of <em class="phrase">Microsoft</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">Windows Vista</em>, which last played host to a VB100 comparative in August 2007. The user base of the <em class="productname">Vista</em> platform continues to grow slowly, with <em class="productname">XP</em> still the platform of choice for the vast majority of desktop users &ndash; most estimates suggest <em class="productname">XP</em> resides on between 70% and 80% of systems, while <em class="productname">Vista</em> still runs on less than 20% almost two years after its introduction. This pattern looks likely to change as sales of XP are gradually retired, but hard-core <em class="productname">Vista</em>-haters continue to insist they&rsquo;ll wait it out and see what the next iteration looks like before abandoning <em class="productname">XP</em>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the x64 architecture, having had a rather longer time to mature, seems to have become the standard for current processors, with straight x86 fading away into the past. The close compatibility between the two, which has helped this growth considerably, means that many continue to use x86 operating systems and not take full advantage of the architecture, while those running full-blown x64 setups expect to find all their 32-bit applications running without difficulty &ndash; although, in this area mileage may vary considerably. The AMD64-based hardware used for much of the testing in the <span class="emphasis"><em>VB</em></span> test lab generally idles along happily running 32-bit operating systems, but once in a while we allow it full rein with a platform designed specifically for the architecture. This is always a cause for concern in VB100 testing, where history has taught us that &lsquo;fully compatible&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean identical behaviours.</p><p>The installation and setup of <em class="productname">Vista</em> is fairly straightforward, but was hampered as usual by the Machiavellian activation process and complications porting images from one system to another for maximum similarity. The standard set of tweaks were made to the default installation after applying the recent service pack &ndash; drivers for display and networking hardware were added, network shares connected, and users and passwords set up. For the purposes of this test, an admin-level user was used throughout, with the User Access Controls running in their default state &ndash; while we anticipated some annoyances from the likely large numbers of pop-ups, it seemed appropriate to monitor how various products integrated with this safety measure. </p><p>The test sets meanwhile underwent their usual minor upgrades, with much of our efforts concentrated on broader upgrades across the lab in preparation for more significant changes in upcoming tests. A sizeable chunk of new software was added to the clean set, and the trojan set used in the previous test was retired and replaced entirely with samples gathered in the last three months. We hope to introduce the same pattern of replenishment with fresh samples for the other test sets in time for the next review, along with some entirely new sets, more on which later.</p><p>The WildList set was aligned with the September issue of the WildList, which was released towards the end of October, a few weeks prior to the product deadline. The changes since the previous set included the addition of another flood of online gaming password-stealers, and the retirement of large swathes of older material. These included most of the bot families that once dominated, along with significant numbers of worms such as W32/Stration (aka Warezov) and W32/Rontokbro (aka Brontok). Several more variants of W32/Virut also fell from the list, indicating a gradual decline in numbers of a family which has caused more than its fair share of difficulties in detection, but we hope to add some of these variants to the polymorphic set, in greatly increased numbers, to ensure detection for this tricky kind of malware remains up to scratch. A few other, less sophisticated items were added to this set this month.</p><p>With minimal changes to our own sets, and expansion of the WildList set sizeable but fairly uniform, there looked to be few potholes for products to trip on this month. </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4572466"></a>Results</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4203425"></a>Agnitum Outpost Security Suite Pro 2009 6.5.2358.316.0607</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Agnitum</em> has become a regular participant in our tests over the past year or so, and the product has made itself welcome with good design and solid functionality. The installation process sparked a yellow alert from the UAC system, defaulting to cancel, followed by some more warnings which were eliminated by allowing the system to &lsquo;always trust&rsquo; <em class="productname">Agnitum</em>. With these hurdles bypassed, the installation process took a few minutes followed by a reboot, and we were good to go. The interface is simple and clear, with ample controls and fine-tuning available, and everything seemed to run smoothly with no jerks or lags.</p><p>Speeds weren&rsquo;t the best, but false positives were absent across the clean and speed sets. Detection in the WildList set was above reproach, and fairly good elsewhere, although a little less than might be hoped for in the trojans set. The product features a variety of behavioural protection mechanisms as part of its main component (the highly regarded firewall), so many of the samples missed in the other sets may in fact be protected against in other ways in a real-world setting. Achieving the VB100 requirements without difficulty, <em class="productname">Agnitum</em> takes the first award of the month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>53.04%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.94%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>80.15%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3224753"></a>AhnLab V3 Internet Security 7.0 Platinum Edition 7.6.4.1</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AhnLab</em>&rsquo;s product only produced a basic alert from the UAC system, and installed rapidly without the need for a reboot. The interface seemed fairly clear and lucid, but this proved to be deceptive, as numerous vital controls are tucked away where you would least expect them. There were some ominous lags when opening logs (perhaps understandably as large amounts of information were involved) but also when accessing the file system browser as part of the manual scan process. When faced with a 25s pause for a simple browse dialog on a fast modern machine, one could be forgiven for suspecting something is wrong. </p><p>Scanning speeds reflected this slightly lethargic attitude, but were far from dismal. Detection rates were much better than expected, after the developers have put some hard work into catching up with the polymorphic set in recent months. Across the clean sets, a large number of files were flagged on demand, which seemed particularly odd as many of them were in areas reserved for files accompanying standard <em class="productname">Windows</em> installations. Closer inspection of logs showed that the &lsquo;malware&rsquo; in question was labelled &lsquo;W97M/Macro&rsquo;, together with the information that a macro removal tool could be used to remove the offending items. After much consideration and close analysis of the wording of logs, it was decided that, though it was a very close call and some users could be alarmed by it, this intentional detection did not count as a full false alarm. <em class="phrase">AhnLab</em> thus qualifies for a VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>66.73%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.87%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>99.78%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3727210"></a>Alwil avast! 4.8 Pro</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Alwil</em>&rsquo;s <em class="productname">avast!</em> continues to delight and baffle in equal measure, with a lightning-fast install hindered only by the UAC at the start, followed by a reboot and further UAC pop-ups requesting permission to access the interface. This itself remains unchanged, a combination of stylized simple controls with an &lsquo;enhanced&rsquo; version for power users. The full control system is a rather ungainly thing which, with the benefit of considerable experience, was eventually wrangled into the required shape and lumbered its way through the tests. On-demand scanning speeds were quite impressive, but on-access speeds somewhat less so.</p><p>Detection, on the other hand, was superb, with an excellent score in the new trojans set and even better elsewhere. The WildList presented no difficulties, and in the clean sets a number of files in deep archives were warned against as potential decompression bombs. While these caused no problems, another file was mislabelled as malware which, unfortunately for <em class="phrase">Alwil</em>, was enough to spoil its chances of a VB100 this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb_fail_small.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>93.21%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.82%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>91.38%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>1</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3721446"></a>AVG Internet Security 8.0.199</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">AVG</em> is a big player in the free-AV market, soon to be joined by an offering from <em class="phrase">Microsoft</em>, but the company&rsquo;s full suite offers an impressive selection of extras. These are made the most of by a main interface crammed to bursting with buttons advertising the various protective layers available, rendering it somewhat cluttered and overwhelming. The installation is quite a slog, with an initial UAC prompt followed by numerous stages including the offer of <em class="productname">Yahoo! Search</em> toolbars, the setting up of various scheduled checks, selection of networking options and so on, before a reboot finally finishes things off.</p><p>Once up and running, the busy interface fairly sensibly requires UAC confirmation to get to the on-access controls, and is reasonably well laid out with accessible but less than comprehensive configuration controls. Speeds were very good on access but a little less splendid on demand where things were a little more thorough. False positives were absent, and detection rates again quite excellent across all sets. With no problems in the WildList, <em class="productname">AVG</em> wins a VB100 award this month.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>96.10%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.96%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>91.74%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id2931382"></a>Avira AntiVir Pro 8.2.0.609</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="phrase">Avira</em> is another of the leading players in the free market, if it can be called such, and has an excellent reputation for detection. The product&rsquo;s installation process was a little less slick, with another of the yellow UAC pop-ups warning of &lsquo;unidentified&rsquo; software, and a readme appearing over the top of a dialog box towards the end. The installation was followed by an attempt to scan the system, which was eventually stopped after some initial difficulties, and testing got under way.</p><p>The interface is another of those that appears straightforward but has deceptive moments of illogic, and this was not only apparent on the surface.

This proved mostly quite decent, with no difficulties in the WildList and no false positives, and <em class="productname">VirusBuster</em> is thus awarded another VB100 for its efforts.</span></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>53.16%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>99.94%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>78.21%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4388447"></a>Webroot I.S.

Configuration is very minimal, and responsiveness somehow even lower, with huge time lags between various components, most notably the file browsing to select areas to scan. Scanning times were also rather slow, and although once again the on-access component appeared not to be sparked by simple file accesses, times were still recorded for this test as they were in some cases slower than other products that did scan the files.</p><p>Logging also proved an issue, with all data discarded after 1,000 lines, not much by the standards we require. Nevertheless, with a combination of careful scanning of tiny portions of our sets at a time, copying files around and to the system and allowing the product to mangle them as it saw fit, then comparing the results with the originals to check for changes, we finally managed to get some usable results. The results seemed to tally fairly closely with those of the Sophos engine at the core of the product&rsquo;s detection capabilities. This meant that there were no issues in either the WildList or clean sets, and that, despite annoying the test team quite thoroughly, <em class="phrase">Webroot</em> earned another VB100 award.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/vb100logo.gif" /></div><div class="segmentedlist"><div class="seglistitem"><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">ItW (o/a): </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Trojans: </span></strong>68.84%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Worms &amp; bots: </span></strong>100.00%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">Polymorphic: </span></strong>89.83%</div><div class="seg"><strong><span class="segtitle">False positives: </span></strong>0</div></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id3979813"></a>Results tables</h2></div></div></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/12/on-access-table.jpg" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/12/on-demand-table.jpg" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/12/archive.jpg" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/12/file-access-lag-table.jpg" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/12/throughput-table.jpg" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/12/lag-graph.jpg" /></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="/uploads/images/figures/2008/12/on-demand-through-graph.jpg" /></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4336045"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div></div><p>On top of the already rather arduous task of getting through multiple tests on multiple products, this month presented more than the average number of small annoyances and petty frustrations. These included bizarre and buggy interfaces, hidden or absent options, and unreliable behaviours, as well as a few more major issues, including product freezes and crashes, blatant contradiction of advertised behaviours, and the occasional product which all but defied testing. Much of this can be put down to the less than ubiquitous platform, but developers claiming to support a given platform need to ensure that their products undergo full and thorough quality assurance. </p><p>This month&rsquo;s test has been notable for the more than usually high number of passes &ndash; indeed only two products failed to meet the required standard, with a couple of other close calls. It seems appropriate to remind readers that we expect products to pass our base test requirements on a regular basis, that the VB100 requirements are not intended as an indication of superlative products, merely of adequate and reasonably reliable ones. The purpose of the scheme is to provide certification of products proven to be legitimate, and to provide a basic level of protection. A single test result should not be taken in a vacuum, but patterns and trends of performance over time can be a valuable guide to the trustworthiness of a product and its developers.</p><p>In addition to the plain pass/fail outcomes which some take to be the be-all and end-all of the VB100, we provide a wide range of additional information on the products that take part, including measurements of scanning speed and overheads, overviews of additional functionality and usability, and detection rates over a selection of additional test sets. </p><p>In the next VB100, we plan to introduce a major addition to this range of extras, based on weekly test sets built up in the weeks immediately prior to, and shortly after, the product submission deadline. This should provide a useful indicator of how well developers are keeping up with the ever-growing flood of new malware samples seen on a daily basis, many of them frequently morphed and fine-tuned with the explicit aim of avoiding detection by anti-malware software. The test should also provide some insight into how well heuristic and generic detection techniques are allowing products to detect malware as yet unseen by analysis labs. </p><p>Details of the new test system, which we have dubbed &lsquo;<span class="emphasis"><em>RAP</em></span>&rsquo;, standing for <span class="emphasis"><em>Reactive And Proactive</em></span> measuring, were presented at the recent <span class="emphasis"><em>VB</em></span> conference and have since been opened to deeper consultation with interested parties. In its fully developed form the new test should provide clear and easily understood additional data, which will also build up over time to show long-term trends and patterns of improvement, stagnation or decline in the performance of scanner products.</p><p>This will go some way to providing more information on the performance and capabilities of current security software, but of course there are many diverse new functions being added to solutions with every new generation, many of which require major shifts in test design to properly measure their efficacy. In conjunction with groups like AMTSO, our own expert advisory board and other interested parties, we will continue to investigate and develop new testing methodologies, and even new certification schemes, that will enable us to more accurately evaluate the products&rsquo; full capabilities. We hope to make many more strides in this direction in the course of the coming year, and as always we welcome any feedback, input, suggestions and opinions from our readers.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a class="chapter" id="id4368054"></a>Technical details</h2></div></div></div><p><b>Test environment.&nbsp;</b>All products were tested on identical systems with <em class="productname">AMD Athlon64 X2 </em>Dual Core 5200+ processors, 2 GB RAM, dual 80 GB and 400 GB hard drives, running <em class="productname">Microsoft Windows Vista Business Edition</em> (64-bit).</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Any developers interested in submitting products for VB&#39;s comparative reviews should contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f1510171151171e081a0c3f09160d0a0c1d0b11511c1012" target="_top"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1a7075727434727b6d7f695a6c73686f69786e7434797577">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
