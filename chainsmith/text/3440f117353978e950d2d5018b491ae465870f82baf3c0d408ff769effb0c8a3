Recently, cybercriminals spamvertised yet another massive email campaign, impersonating the world’s most popular social network – Facebook.
It was similar to a previously profiled spam campaign imitating Facebook. However, in this case the cybercriminals behind it relied on attached malicious archives, compared to including exploits and malware serving links in the email.
More details:

Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

Detection rate for the malicious archive: MD5: 0938302fbf8f7db161e46c558660ae0b – detected by 34 out of 43 antivirus scanners as Trojan.Generic.KDV.753880; Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Gimemo.arsu. Upon execution, the sample opens a backdoor on the infected host, allowing the cybercriminals behind the campaign to gain full access to the affected host.
