3DS Emulator: Press Start to Load Surveys
News of The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask remake got you looking into 3DS emulators?
We recently looked at sites claiming to offer up working emulators based on consoles such as the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Here’s a site located at
3dsemulator(dot)org
which has a Nintendo 3DS emulator up for grabs…supposedly.

As with similar sites, the idea is to download the emulator then grab a so-called ROM separately. Installing the emulator will prompt the user to download and install the required version of .NET in order for it to run correctly.

A quick reboot later, and:

The box reads as follows:
eMu3Ds is not activated! You need activate it in order to play games, would you like to activate it now?
Clicking Yes causes the “emulator” to open up a selection of survey offers.

Elsewhere, the “ROM” file opens up IE after installing – presenting the end-user with a clickable advert:

Users of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware will find we detect this ROM file as PUP.Optional.OutBrowse (VirusTotal 28 / 52, Malwr analysis).
If you’re going to look for emulators online, be very careful what you download and remember that there’s a lot of fakes and scams just waiting to pull in another unsuspecting victim.
