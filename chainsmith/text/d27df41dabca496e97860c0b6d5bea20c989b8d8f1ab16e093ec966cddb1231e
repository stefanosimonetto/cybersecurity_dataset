eBay Giftcard Spam Mails in Circulation
From the spam traps, a mail landing unannounced in a mailbox near you:

It reads:
* * * * * * * * * * * * * Your $25 EBay Gift-Card * * * * * * * * * * * * *
—————————————————————————–
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

*Hurry as they go fast.
The link is intended for residents of the US, but has been spammed out to random individuals who could be anywhere in the World – not exactly targeted marketing!
First the destination site asks for a valid email address, then they follow up with name / address / phone / zipcode style requests.

Always be cautious when asked to hand over personal information such as the above via random spam messages – you can never quite be sure who sent it or what they intend to do with the data. Unsolicited giftcard messages can come in many forms and the next one you click on might not “just” be a collection of survey questions…
