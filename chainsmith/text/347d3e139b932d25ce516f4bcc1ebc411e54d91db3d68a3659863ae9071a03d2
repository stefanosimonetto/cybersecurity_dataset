Last week Adobe released the APSB12-17 Flash Player update. The update patches two critical security flaws — CVE-2012-0772 and CVE-2012-0773 — in the Adobe Flash player, and also, for the first time ever, introduces auto-patching mechanism. The update affects the following operating systems – Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris.

More details:

By default, all users are opted-out of the auto-patching mechanism. Webroot highly recommends that users opt-in, and start taking advantage of the feature in order to ensure that the latest security updates are automatically pushed by Adobe in a timely manner. For the time being, the feature is only available to Windows users.
End and corporate users can download the latest version of the Adobe Flash Player from this web site. Users of Google’s Chrome, which includes the Flash Player plugin by default, can take advantage of the latest Flash Player update, in Chrome’s latest update, version 18.0.1025.142.
