The Microsoft Malware Protection Center reported earlier this week a sighting of a malicious PDF file exploiting CVE-2010-0188. Adobe released 9.2.1 and 8.2.1 in February.
Users can pull down the ‘help’ menu and click on ‘check for updates’ to ensure that they’re running the latest version.
One lesson learned here is don’t skip deploying a patch just because no exploits are out for it. it will leave you scrambling later.
Adobe’s next scheduled Reader and Acrobat update is due April 13.
