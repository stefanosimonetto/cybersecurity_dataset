Thanks to this SANS ISC story, I learned of Liveview.  It's a program that converts disk images made with dd into VMware images.  I decided to try the program on one of the images from Real Digital Forensics.  We provide two images on the DVD: JBRWWW.dd.gz and BRJDEV.dd.gz.  JBRWWW.dd.gz is a Windows image.  Since we had to zero out Windows binaries in that image, it can't be booted.  BRJDEV.dd.gz is a Linux image.  The Liveview Web site shows there is "limited" support for Linux, but I decided to see how far I could get.Before gunzipping BRJDEV.dd.gz, I needed to patch it.  For some reason the copy on the book DVD is corrupted.  I followed the instructions at realdigitalforensics.com to patch the image.orr:/home/richard$ ls -al *.gz-rw-rw-rw-  1 richard  richard  181673834 Aug 29 15:06 BRJDEV.dd.gz-rw-rw-rw-  1 richard  richard  389144043 Aug 29 14:34 JBRWWW.dd.gzorr:/home/richard$ ls -al patch0001.bin -rw-r--r--  1 richard  richard  42635114 Mar  7 12:16 patch0001.binorr:/home/richard$ dd if=patch0001.bin of=BRJDEV.dd.gz bs=512 seek=271560 83271+1 records in83271+1 records out42635114 bytes transferred in 5.059636 secs (8426518 bytes/sec)orr:/home/richard$ ls -al *.gz-rw-rw-rw-  1 richard  richard  181673834 Aug 29 15:26 BRJDEV.dd.gz-rw-rw-rw-  1 richard  richard  389144043 Aug 29 14:34 JBRWWW.dd.gzorr:/home/richard$ md5 BRJDEV.dd.gzMD5 (BRJDEV.dd.gz) = 3f274b39803068d69f8b62730e101d64Since BRJDEV.dd.gz had the proper MD5 hash, I moved it over to my Windows station, gunzipped it, and then ran Liveview.  I tried to run Liveview on FreeBSD (it's Java), but I saw too many errors.

Liveview is easy enough to use.  I pointed it at the proper .dd file, and told it where I wanted the image produced.Liveview built a .vmx file, a .vmdk file, and told VMware Server where to find the new VM.  At this point it looked ready to start, so I fired up VMware Server.Things started to proceed well.  I got a Linux bootloader image, so something was working.  The Linux kernel started to load too.Unfortunately, I didn't get very far.  Eventually Linux reported a kernel panic and complained that it was unable to mount the root filesystem.I believe I would have more success if I used an image of a Windows system, but I do not have one handy.  While writing this blog I found dd2vmdk, a project with similar goals.  I bet VMware's P2V might import dd images, but I'm not sure.
