We do not recommend to use the BETA on larger production servers (even if we already use it to filter our own mail – and it works great)
The public BETA ISO image carry the version number 5.050. We will neither provide a Up2Date package to upgrade your existing V5 to this BETA release nor will we publish an Up2Date Package to upgrade from the pubic BETA to the final ASL V5.100.
Backup files from ASL V5.027 will work on the public BETA, backup files from the public BETA will work on the final V5.100. This upgrade does not need a new license or a special license. Any ASL V5 license can be used.
