I've been working with Snort 2.6.0 on FreeBSD.When you look at the snort.conf you'll see a bunch of rules commented out.# include $RULE_PATH/web-attacks.rules# include $RULE_PATH/backdoor.rules# include $RULE_PATH/shellcode.rules# include $RULE_PATH/policy.rules# include $RULE_PATH/porn.rules# include $RULE_PATH/info.rules# include $RULE_PATH/icmp-info.rules# include $RULE_PATH/virus.rules# include $RULE_PATH/chat.rules# include $RULE_PATH/multimedia.rules# include $RULE_PATH/p2p.rules# include $RULE_PATH/spyware-put.rulesWhen you start Snort you'll see it uses much more memory compared to earlier versions.  654 root        1 -58    0   248M   247M bpf    0   0:01  3.30% snortIf this is too much, and you are willing to sacrifice Snort performance, you can enable the following in snort.conf:config detection: search-method lowmemThis results in less memory usage.  656 root        1 -58    0 39800K 39128K bpf    0   0:01  0.00% snortWith this option enabled you can even uncomment all rules.  661 root        1 -58    0 59224K 58580K bpf    0   0:01  1.95% snortWhat if you want the best performance and all rules?  Well, on FreeBSD you are going to encounter a 512 MB default RAM limitation that will prevent Snort from running.  # limitcputime      unlimitedfilesize     unlimiteddatasize     524288 kbytesstacksize    65536 kbytescoredumpsize unlimitedmemoryuse    unlimitedvmemoryuse   unlimiteddescriptors  11095 memorylocked unlimitedmaxproc      5547 sbsize       unlimitedYou can change this by making the following entries in /boot/loader.conf:kern.dfldsiz="1G"                # Set the initial data size limitkern.maxdsiz="1G"                # Set the max data sizeReboot when done.  Here is the result.# limitcputime      unlimitedfilesize     unlimiteddatasize     1048576 kbytesstacksize    65536 kbytescoredumpsize unlimitedmemoryuse    unlimitedvmemoryuse   unlimiteddescriptors  11095 memorylocked unlimitedmaxproc      5547 sbsize       unlimitedNow you can run Snort with all rules and best performance, and see it occupies over 900 MB.  645 root        1 -58    0   925M   926M bpf    0   0:04  0.00% snortI have not tested Snort to see the effect of various options, although I prefer to run as many rule sets as makes sense for my environment.  Note I did not add Bleeding or Community rule sets for this example.
