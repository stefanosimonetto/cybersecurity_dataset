By: Eugene Rodionov, Aleksandr Matrosov, and Dmitry Volkov, August 2011

Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of Win32/Hodprot, one of the families of malware most used in banking fraud in Russia and its neighbours.

(It’s actually 15 pages: pretty slender compared to our Stuxnet report, but lots of interesting detail nonetheless.)

I’ll probably return to the topic in a future blog, but I think the world has heard enough from me for today.
