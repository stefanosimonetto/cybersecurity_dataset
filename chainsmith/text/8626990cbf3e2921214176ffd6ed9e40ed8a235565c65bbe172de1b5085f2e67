I haven't been reading the FreeBSD mailing lists regularly.  Today I looked into the freebsd-stable list and saw the FreeBSD 5.4 Release Schedule posted.  Highlights include: Feb. 23 newvers.sh starts to say 5.4-PRERELEASE Mar. 2  RELENG_5 code freeze begins Mar. 4  Public test release build called 5.4-PRERELEASE Mar. 16 Branch RELENG_5_4, unfreeze RELENG_5 Mar. 18 5.4-RC1 Mar. 25 5.4-RC2 Apr. 4  5.4-RELEASE You can watch the schedule and open issues pages as the release engineering process continues.
