SecurityFocus Interview with Mpack Criminal

Posted by Roger on 22 July 2007, 12:00 pm

Securityfocus has an interview with DCT a developer of MPack.
DCT says, “Well, I feel that we are just a factory producing ammunition.” Ammunition can be used for multiple purposes. You can hunt game and provide food for your family. You can shoot targets and have hours of entertainment. You can defend yourself and others against bad guys. You can commit a 187. Mpack can’t make that claim. Its sole us is criminal. Exploit as ammunition is a argument that metasploit can make. That can be used for legitimate purposes. I don’t see that with Mpack.
DCT also tries to push the idea that they are just a bunch of guys having fun in their spare time. He/she scoffs at the idea that Mpack is related to the Russian Mob.
