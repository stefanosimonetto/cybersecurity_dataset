A new Up2Date is available for Sophos UTM. Release 9.103 fixes some bugs and increases the stability of your UTM 9 installation. We have adjusted the WebAdmin permissions for some of the User Management roles, and introduced some new performance tuning for Intrusion Protection which will be further improved on a continuing basis to optimize this area more precisely per-appliance. We have also adjusted some notifications around RED and VPN tunnels. Read on for the package specifics.
