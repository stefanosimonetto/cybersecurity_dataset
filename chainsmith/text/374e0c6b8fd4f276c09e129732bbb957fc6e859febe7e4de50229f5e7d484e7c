Symantec False Positive on AVCenter webpage

I learned about this over in a thread over at BroadBandReports.com. It seems that if you go to the writeup for the new Macintosh worm Inqtana.a over at the Symantec (SARC) AVCenter you get a virus detection of OSX.Inqtana.A in that temporary internet file. This of course is a false positive.
I am using the 2/17 rev 18 virus definitions. 2/18 rev 5 is out and reportedly that solves the problem.
