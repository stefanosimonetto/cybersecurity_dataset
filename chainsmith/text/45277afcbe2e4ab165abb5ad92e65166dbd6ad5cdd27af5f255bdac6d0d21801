“The Rock is Dead” Fast & Furious 7 Scam In Circulation
Dwayne Johnson – AKA The Rock – is currently being targeted by a rather grim Facebook scam doing the rounds, originating from

“R. I. P. DWAYNE JOHNSON (1972 – 2014). He died filming a dangerous stunt for FAST & FURIOUS 7”
Spoilers: no, he didn’t. As with all of these scams, users are asked to share on Facebook. This one tries a different tack with regards directing them to the eventual surveys, sending them to a second page with a prominent pop-up box:

“Facebook Media Plugin Required: download and install the plugin to watch the video”
In testing, clicking the link took us to a PUP (potentially unwanted program) iLivid install which users of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware will find we detect as PUP.Optional.Bandoo (VirusTotal 7 / 51).
Of course, Fast & Furious 7 has experienced a rather tragic end for one of the stars of the film but that was away from the movie; The Rock hasn’t experienced any such disaster and users of Facebook should resist the temptation to share / click / install / everything else where claims of The Rock meeting a grisly demise are concerned.
