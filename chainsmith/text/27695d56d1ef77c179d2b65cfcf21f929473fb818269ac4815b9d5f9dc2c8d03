We are pleased to announce the availability of Astaro Security Linux 2.0! Following major enhancements are part of Astaro Security Linux 2.0:

SCSI Hard disk support (see the detailed supported Hardware list at asl-hardware.txt)
Gigabit NIC support
Road warrior-VPN support via PPTP
WebAdmin allows to cancel a session opened by another administrator, if urgent Login requirements exist
The WebAdmin TCP port is now configurable
WebAdmin support for managing virus infected emails
WebAdmin support for Portscan Detection options
Audible alarm to monitor the Startup (5 beeps) or Shutdown (beeps until power off) of headless firewall appliances
System Up2date Service has been separated from virus pattern Up2date Service, each service has individual options (e.g. check every hour for virus pattern updates, and do system updates manually)
Backup-files can be emailed automatically in user defined time intervals
Additional keyboard layouts are supported during installation (US, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Netherland)
Self-signed SSL certificate generation
Remote logging via Syslog/SNMP (see syslog howto or snmp howto)
Proxy ARP support
IP Aliases can be assigned to Network Interfaces
Multiport Tulip NICs drivers have been updated

The release schedule for upgrading existing users is as follows:

Up2Dates for upgrading from 1.8xx will be provided beginning of September.
Up2Dates for upgrading from 1.952 to Astaro Security Linux 2.0 will be released next week.
Up2dates for Sun/Cobalt and a new Sun/Cobalt Installation ISO will be available mid September.
The upgrade to 2.0 is free of charge for all 1.8 customers! Backup will work for 1.8xx (1.9xx) -> 2.0 migration. Please remember to export your IPSec VPN RSA key separately – this key is not included in backup files!
If you import a 1.8 backup file with user definitions, you have to re-define these user definitions, if you want to use them for PPTP.
Self-generated SSL certificates are not saved, please recreate it again after installation.

Non-commercial users please note that it will not be possible to activate SMTP virus protection without a valid license key anymore.
We will announce a special virus protection-pricing for non-commercial users this week.
