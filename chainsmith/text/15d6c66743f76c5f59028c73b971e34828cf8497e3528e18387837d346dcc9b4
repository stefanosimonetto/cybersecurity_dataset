Network up2date

An Up2Date was released today for Astaro Security Gateway Version 8. This Up2Date is designed to improve the stability of your V8 installation, offers some security patches, and acts as the new target landing version for appliance users who one-touch upgrade to ASG V8 via the 7.508 Up2Date which will be released next week. At that time full details around the appliance upgrade process will be published, and we’ll have an update on the progress of the 8.100 Beta & GA as well.

8.003 provides some fixes for those who will upgrade to ASG V8 from V7, and another set  of fixes to address some security advisories in bzip2 and ClamAV.
*Note: Users of a previous, pre-GA "soft-release" of this 8.003 should re-apply this Up2Date to resolve issues with Anti-Spam daemon restarts and importing V7 backups into V8 installations which have HA configured. (See the forums if you need help with this)
