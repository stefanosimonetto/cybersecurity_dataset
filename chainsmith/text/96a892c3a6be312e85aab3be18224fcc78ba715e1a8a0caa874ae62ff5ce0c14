Recent Flash Zero-Day Now Part of Exploit Kits
The Adobe Flash Player continues to be the favourite browser plugin threat actors have been focusing on this year. The recent zero-day exploit that was used in targeted attacks is now part of mainstream exploit kits.
Angler EK and Nuclear EK now include the latest CVE-2015-7645 which was patched by Adobe on October 16. This vulnerability affects Adobe Flash up to version 19.0.0.207.

Both Exploit Kits are blocked by Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit before they even have the chance to unleash their malicious payload.
Because Flash has been such a hot target this year, it is recommended to either disable it or remove it entirely.
People that choose to keep it should always ensure they are running the latest version but also run an exploit mitigation tool in parallel to account for zero-days.
