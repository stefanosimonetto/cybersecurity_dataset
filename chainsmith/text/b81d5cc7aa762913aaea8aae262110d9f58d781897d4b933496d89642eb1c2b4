Comment SPAM Bad Neighborhood Analysis (2013-Mar)

We track and block a lot of comment SPAM via our WordPress plugin and our CloudProxy WAF. One thing we noticed is that the majority of the SPAM we detect come from the same “bad neighbors” (IP ranges that are known for sending a lot of SPAM).
We did a little query for the month of March (just in 23 days) and these are the top 20 networks used by comment Spammers:
