More attacks – Hilary Kneber and meqashoppecom – Part II

Today, we’re seeing a small variation of this attack. We’re continuing our research, but it seems the attack has spread to another host, and maybe more. The attackers are using meqashoppercom.com to spread the malware and the following javascript gets added to the affected sites (result from our scanner):

Here is the malware entry.
Note: The domain meqashoppercom.com (77.78.240.233, 77.78.239.53) IS NOT blacklisted, so it has the potential to infect a very large number of visitors, specifically visitors with outdated AV signatures and definitions.
What’s interesting is that the domain is registered by the same people responsible for the previous attacks at Godaddy, Bluehost, etc: Hillary Kneber:
