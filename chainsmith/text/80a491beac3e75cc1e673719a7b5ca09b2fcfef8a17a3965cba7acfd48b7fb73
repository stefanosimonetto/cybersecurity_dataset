Over the past 24 hours, cybercriminals launched yet another massive spam campaign, this time impersonating American Airlines in an attempt to trick its customers into clicking on a malicious link found in the mail. Upon clicking on the link, users are exposed to the client-side exploits served by the Black Hole Exploit Kit v2.0
More details:

Sample screenshot of the spamvertised email:

We’ve already seen the same malicious email used in the previously profiled “Cybercriminals impersonate UPS, serve client-side exploits and malware” campaign, clearly indicating that these campaigns are launched by the same cybercriminal/gang of cybercriminals.
Webroot SecureAnywhere users are proactively protected from this threat.
