Sometimes this blog is just a place for me to take notes on tasks I want to repeat in the future, like burning CDs.  In this case I'm running Ubuntu and using the new portable Sony DRX-S50U Multi-Format DVD Burner I bought to accompany my Thinkpad x60s on the road.  First I created an .iso of the files I wanted on the CD-R.richard@neely:/var/tmp$ mkisofs -J -R -o /data/shmoocon2007hack.iso shmoocon2007/INFO:   UTF-8 character encoding detected by locale settings.
